Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN).

However, current methods remain unreliable. Without a solid theoretical footing, the refinement process can wander; sometimes it settles, sometimes it loops back, and sometimes it breaks away from any stable trajectory. This work bridges this critical gap by developing an LLM-Verifier Convergence Theorem, providing the first formal framework with provable guarantees for termination and convergence. We model the interaction between the LLM and the verifier as a discrete-time Markov Chain, with state transitions determined by a key parameter: the error-reduction probability ($\u03b4$). The procedure reaching the Verified state almost surely demonstrates that the program terminates for any $\u03b4> 0$, with an expected iteration count bounded by $\\mathbb{E}[n] \\leq 4/\u03b4$. We then stress-tested this prediction in an extensive empirical campaign comprising more than 90,000 trials. The empirical results match the theory with striking consistency. Every single run reached verification, and the convergence factor clustered tightly around $C_f\\approx$ 1.0. Consequently, the bound mirrors the system's actual behavior. The evidence is sufficiently robust to support dividing the workflow into three distinct operating zones: marginal, practical, and high-performance. Consequently, we establish the design thresholds with absolute confidence. Together, the theoretical guarantee and the experimental evidence provide a clearer architectural foundation for LLM-assisted verification.

But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated.

Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone.

To address this, we present ReMindView-Bench, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating how VLMs construct, align and maintain spatial mental models across complementary viewpoints. ReMindView-Bench systematically varies viewpoint spatial pattern and query type to probe key factors of spatial cognition. Evaluations of 15 current VLMs reveals consistent failures in cross-view alignment and perspective-taking in multi-view spatial reasoning, motivating deeper analysis on the reasoning process. Explicit phase-wise analysis using LLM-as-a-judge and self-consistency prompting shows that VLMs perform well on in-frame perception but degrade sharply when integrating information across views. Implicit analysis, including linear probing and entropy dynamics, further show progressive loss of task-relevant information and uncertainty separation between correct and incorrect trajectories.

The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models.

Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline.

In this study, we propose a systematic evaluation framework for belief entrenchment in LLM reasoning by leveraging the Martingale property from Bayesian statistics. This property implies that, under rational belief updating, the expected value of future beliefs should remain equal to the current belief, i.e., belief updates are unpredictable from the current belief. We propose the unsupervised, regression-based Martingale Score to measure violations of this property, which signal deviation from the Bayesian ability of updating on new evidence. In open-ended problem domains including event forecasting, value-laden questions, and academic paper review, we find such violations to be widespread across models and setups, where the current belief positively predicts future belief updates, a phenomenon which we term belief entrenchment. We identify the models, reasoning techniques, and domains more prone to belief entrenchment. Finally, we validate the Martingale Score by showing that it predicts ground-truth accuracy on problem domains where ground truth labels are available.

With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
