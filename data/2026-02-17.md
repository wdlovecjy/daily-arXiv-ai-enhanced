Abstract: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a reduction in business and routine activity and resulted in less motor fuel consumption. Thus, the gas tax revenue is reduced which is the major funding resource supporting the rehabilitation and maintenance of transportation infrastructure systems. The focus of this study is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on transportation infrastructure funds in the United States through analyzing the motor fuel consumption data. Machine learning models were developed by integrating COVID-19 scenarios, fuel consumptions, and demographic data. The best model achieves an R2-score of more than 95% and captures the fluctuations of fuel consumption during the pandemic. Using the developed model, we project future motor gas consumption for each state. For some states, the gas tax revenues are going to be 10%-15% lower than the pre-pandemic level for at least one or two years.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We systematically evaluate the reproducibility of data analysis conducted by Large Language Models (LLMs). We evaluate two prompting strategies, six models, and four temperature settings, with ten independent executions per configuration, yielding 480 total attempts. We assess the completion, concordance, validity, and consistency of each attempt and find considerable variation in the analytical results even for consistent configurations. This suggests, as with human data analysis, the data analysis conducted by LLMs can vary, even given the same task, data, and settings. Our results mean that if an LLM is being used to conduct data analysis, then it should be run multiple times independently and the distribution of results considered.

Abstract: Repeating an imperfect biomarker test based on an initial result can introduce bias and influence misclassification risk. For example, in some blood donation settings, blood donors' hemoglobin is remeasured when the initial measurement falls below a minimum threshold for donor eligibility. This paper explores methods that use data resulting from processes with conditionally repeated biomarker measurement to decompose the variation in observed measurements of a continuous biomarker into population variability and variability arising from the measurement procedure. We present two frequentist approaches with analytical solutions, but these approaches perform poorly in a dataset of conditionally repeated blood donor hemoglobin measurements where normality assumptions are not met. We then develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework that allows for different distributional assumptions, which we apply to the blood donor hemoglobin dataset. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model that assumes normally distributed population hemoglobin and heavy tailed $t$-distributed measurement variation, we found that the total measurement variation accounted for 22\% of the total variance among females and 25\% among males, with population standard deviations of $1.07\, \rm g/dL$ for female donors and $1.28\, \rm g/dL$ for male donors. Our Bayesian framework can use data resulting from any clinical process with conditionally repeated biomarker measurements to estimate individuals' misclassification risk after one or more noisy continuous measurements and inform evidence-based conditional retesting decision rules.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Individual-level epidemic models are increasingly being used to help understand the transmission dynamics of various infectious diseases. However, fitting such models to individual-level epidemic data is challenging, as we often only know when an individual's disease status was detected (e.g., when they showed symptoms) and not when they were infected or removed. We propose an autoregressive coupled hidden Markov model to infer unknown infection and removal times, as well as other model parameters, from a single observed detection time for each detected individual. Unlike more traditional data augmentation methods used in epidemic modelling, we do not assume that this detection time corresponds to infection or removal or that infected individuals must at some point be detected. Bayesian coupled hidden Markov models have been used previously for individual-level epidemic data. However, these approaches assumed each individual was continuously tested and that the tests were independent. In practice, individuals are often only tested until their first positive test, and even if they are continuously tested, only the initial detection times may be reported. In addition, multiple tests on the same individual may not be independent. We accommodate these scenarios by assuming that the probability of detecting the disease can depend on past observations, which allows us to fit a much wider range of practical applications. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by fitting two examples: an experiment on the spread of tomato spot wilt virus in pepper plants and an outbreak of norovirus among nurses in a hospital.

Abstract: Robust characterization of dynamic causal interactions in multivariate biomedical signals is essential for advancing computational and algorithmic methods in biomedical imaging. Conventional approaches, such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), often assume linear or simple statistical dependencies, while manifold based techniques like Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) capture nonlinear, lagged interactions but lack probabilistic quantification and interventional modeling. We introduce a DBN informed CCM framework that integrates geometric manifold reconstruction with probabilistic temporal modeling. Applied to multimodal EEG-EMG recordings from dystonic and neurotypical children, the method quantifies uncertainty, supports interventional simulation, and reveals distinct frequency specific reorganization of corticomuscular pathways in dystonia. Experimental results show marked improvements in predictive consistency and causal stability as compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the potential of causality aware multimodal modeling for developing quantitative biomarkers and guiding targeted neuromodulatory interventions.

Abstract: This paper focuses on solving a challenging problem of blind deconvolution demixing involving modulated inputs. Specifically, multiple input signals $s_n(t)$, each bandlimited to $B$ Hz, are modulated with known random sequences $r_n(t)$ that alter at rate $Q$. Each modulated signal is convolved with a different M tap channel of impulse response $h_n(t)$, and the outputs of each channel are added at a common receiver to give the observed signal $y(t)=\sum_{n=1}^N (r_n(t)\odot s_n(t))\circledast h_n(t)$, where $\odot$ is the point wise multiplication, and $\circledast$ is circular convolution. Given this observed signal $y(t)$, we are concerned with recovering $s_n(t)$ and $h_n(t)$. We employ deterministic subspace assumption for the input signal $s_n(t)$ and keep the channel impulse response $h_n(t)$ arbitrary. We show that if modulating sequence is altered at a rate $Q \geq N^2 (B+M)$ and sample complexity bound is obeyed then all the signals and the channels, $\{s_n(t),h_n(t)\}_{n=1}^N$, can be estimated from the observed mixture $y(t)$ using gradient descent algorithm. We have performed extensive simulations that show the robustness of our algorithm and used phase transitions to numerically investigate the theoretical guarantees provided by our algorithm.

Abstract: Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) can provide a more complete view of brain function by merging high temporal and spatial resolutions. High-field ($\geq$3T) systems are standard, and require technical trade-offs, including artifacts in the EEG signal, reduced compatibility with metallic implants, high acoustic noise, and artifacts around high-susceptibility areas such as the optic nerve and nasal sinus. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55T in a visual task. We characterize the gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts inherent to this environment and observe reduced BCG magnitude consistent with the expected scaling of pulse-related artifacts with static magnetic field strength. This reduction shows promise for facilitating effective denoising while preserving the alpha rhythm and signal integrity. Furthermore, we tested a multimodal integration pipeline and demonstrated that the EEG power envelope corresponds with the hemodynamic BOLD response, supporting the potential to measure neurovascular coupling in this environment. We demonstrate that combined EEG-fMRI at 0.55T is feasible and represents a promising environment for multimodal neuroimaging.

Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.

Abstract: Quasi-static human activities such as lying, standing or sitting produce very low Doppler shifts and highly spread radar signatures, making them difficult to detect with conventional constant-false-alarm rate (CFAR) detectors tuned for point targets. Moreover, privacy concerns and low lighting conditions limit the use of cameras in long-term care (LTC) facilities. This paper proposes a lightweight, non-visual image-based method for robust quasi-static human presence detection using a low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. On a dataset covering five semi-static activities, the proposed method improves average detection accuracy from 68.3% for Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and 78.8% for Order-Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) to 93.24% for Subject 1, from 51.3%, 68.3% to 92.3% for Subject 2, and 57.72%, 69.94% to 94.82% for Subject 3, respectively. Finally, we benchmarked all three detectors across all activities on a Raspberry Pi 4B using a shared Range-Angle (RA) preprocessing pipeline. The proposed algorithm obtains an average 8.2 ms per frame, resulting in over 120 frames per second (FPS) and a 74 times speed-up over OS-CFAR. These results demonstrate that simple image-based processing can provide robust and deployable quasi-static human sensing in cluttered indoor environments.

Abstract: The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is widely available on commodity WiFi devices but is commonly regarded as too coarse for fine-grained sensing. This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m. These results demonstrate that, despite its lower resolution, RSSI can support practical passive sensing and offers a low-cost alternative to CSI-based WiFi sensing.

Abstract: A key question for most applications involving reconfigurable linear wave systems is how accurately a desired linear operator can be realized by configuring the system's tunable elements. The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis.

Abstract: Signal processing has played, and continues to play, a fundamental role in the evolution of modern localization technologies. Localization using spatial variations in the Earth's magnetic field is no exception. It relies on signal-processing methods for statistical state inference, magnetic-field modeling, and sensor calibration. Contemporary localization techniques based on spatial variations in the magnetic field can provide decimeter-level indoor localization accuracy and outdoor localization accuracy on par with strategic-grade inertial navigation systems. This article provides a broad, high-level overview of current signal-processing principles and open research challenges in localization using spatial variations in the Earth's magnetic field. The aim is to provide the reader with an understanding of the similarities and differences among existing key technologies from a statistical signal-processing perspective. To that end, existing key technologies will be presented within a common parametric signal-model framework compatible with well-established statistical inference methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates secure downlink transmission in a UAV-assisted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled multiuser multiple-input single-output network, where legitimate information-harvesting receivers coexist with untrusted energy-harvesting receivers (UEHRs) capable of eavesdropping. A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases. Simulation results show that the proposed SAC method achieves up to 28% and 16% secrecy energy efficiency gains over SCA and deep deterministic policy gradient baselines, respectively, while demonstrating superior robustness to CSI uncertainty and stable performance across varying transmit power levels and RIS sizes.

Abstract: Integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) presents a promising paradigm for enhancing physical-layer security (PLS) in wireless communications. However, deploying high-resolution quantizers in large-scale mMIMO arrays, along with numerous IRS elements, leads to substantial hardware complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. This leads to a highly non-convex fractional secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, two algorithms are proposed: (1) the WMMSE-PDD algorithm, which reformulates the SRM problem into a sequence of non-fractional programs with auxiliary variables using the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and solves them via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach, achieving superior secrecy performance; and (2) the exact penalty product Riemannian gradient descent (EPPRGD) algorithm, which transforms the SRM problem into an unconstrained optimization over a product Riemannian manifold, eliminating auxiliary variables and enabling faster convergence with a slight trade-off in secrecy performance. Both algorithms provide analytical solutions at each iteration and are proven to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods and highlight their respective advantages.

Abstract: AS-ISTA (Architecture Searched-Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm) and AS-FISTA (AS-Fast ISTA) are compressed sensing algorithms introducing structural parameters to ISTA and FISTA to enable architecture search within the iterative process. The structural parameters are determined using deep unfolding, but this approach requires training data and the large overhead of training time. In this paper, we propose HGD-AS-ISTA (Hypergradient Descent-AS-ISTA) and HGD-AS-FISTA that use hypergradient descent, which is an online hyperparameter optimization method, to determine the structural parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves performance of the conventional ISTA/FISTA while avoiding the need for re-training when the environment changes.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of high-precision target localization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the target is sensed via both a direct path and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted reflection path. We first develop a sequential matched-filter estimator to acquire coarse angular parameters, followed by a range recovery process based on subcarrier phase differences. Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity.

Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) enables communication in RF-denied environments (underground, underwater, in-body), where the medium conductivity imprints a deterministic signature on the channel. This letter derives a closed-form Cramér--Rao bound (CRB) for the joint estimation of range and medium conductivity from MI pilot observations in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. The Fisher information matrix reveals that the joint estimation penalty converges to 3\,dB in the near-field regime, meaning conductivity sensing adds at most a factor-of-two loss in ranging precision. Monte Carlo maximum-likelihood simulations confirm that the CRB is achievable under practical operating conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for computing centroids, or barycenters, in the spectral Wasserstein-2 metric for sets of power spectral densities, where the barycenters are restricted to belong to the set of all-pole spectra with a certain model order. This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification.

Abstract: The Dirac operator provides a unified framework for processing signals defined over different order topological domains, such as node and edge signals. Its eigenmodes define a spectral representation that inherently captures cross-domain interactions, in contrast to conventional Hodge-Laplacian eigenmodes that operate within a single topological dimension. In this paper, we compare the two alternatives in terms of the distortion/sparsity trade-off and we show how an overcomplete basis built concatenating the two dictionaries can provide better performance with respect to each approach. Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases.

Abstract: While synthetic aperture radar is widely adopted to provide high-resolution imaging at long distances using small arrays, the concept of coherent synthetic aperture communication (SAC) has not yet been explored. This article introduces the principles of SAC for direct satellite-to-device uplink, showcasing precise direction-of-arrival estimation for user equipment (UE) devices, facilitating spatial signal separation, localization, and easing link budget constraints. Simulations for a low Earth orbit satellite at 600 km orbit and two UE devices performing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based transmission with polar coding at 3.5 GHz demonstrate block error rates below 0.1 with transmission powers as low as -10 dBm, even under strong interference when UE devices are resolved but fall on each other's strongest angular sidelobe. These results validate the ability of the proposed scheme to address mutual interference and stringent power limitations, paving the way for massive Internet of Things connectivity in non-terrestrial networks.

Abstract: Decades of engineering drawings and technical records remain locked in legacy archives with inconsistent or missing metadata, making retrieval difficult and often manual. We present Blueprint, a layout-aware multimodal retrieval system designed for large-scale engineering repositories. Blueprint detects canonical drawing regions, applies region-restricted VLM-based OCR, normalizes identifiers (e.g., DWG, part, facility), and fuses lexical and dense retrieval with a lightweight region-level reranker. Deployed on ~770k unlabeled files, it automatically produces structured metadata suitable for cross-facility search.
  We evaluate Blueprint on a 5k-file benchmark with 350 expert-curated queries using pooled, graded (0/1/2) relevance judgments.

Abstract: Small datasets like MNIST have historically been instrumental in advancing machine learning research by providing a controlled environment for rapid experimentation and model evaluation. However, their simplicity often limits their utility for distinguishing between advanced neural network architectures. To address these challenges, Greydanus et al. introduced the MNIST-1D dataset, a one-dimensional adaptation of MNIST designed to explore inductive biases in sequential data. This dataset maintains the advantages of small-scale datasets while introducing variability and complexity that make it ideal for studying advanced architectures.
  In this paper, we extend the exploration of MNIST-1D by evaluating the performance of Residual Networks (ResNet), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), and Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). These models, known for their ability to capture sequential patterns and hierarchical features, were implemented and benchmarked alongside previously tested architectures such as logistic regression, MLPs, CNNs, and GRUs. Our experimental results demonstrate that advanced architectures like TCN and DCNN consistently outperform simpler models, achieving near-human performance on MNIST-1D. ResNet also shows significant improvements, highlighting the importance of leveraging inductive biases and hierarchical feature extraction in small structured datasets.
  Through this study, we validate the utility of MNIST-1D as a robust benchmark for evaluating machine learning architectures under computational constraints. Our findings emphasize the role of architectural innovations in improving model performance and offer insights into optimizing deep learning models for resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Machine learning models excel with abundant annotated data, but annotation is often costly and time-intensive. Active learning (AL) aims to improve the performance-to-annotation ratio by using query methods (QMs) to iteratively select the most informative samples. While AL research focuses mainly on QM development, the evaluation of this iterative process lacks appropriate performance metrics. This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics. The results confirm the assumptions underlying the speed-up factor, demonstrate its accuracy in capturing the described fraction, and reveal its superior stability across iterations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing cryoprotectant agent (CPA) cocktails for vitrification is challenging because formulations must be concentrated enough to suppress ice formation yet non-toxic enough to preserve cell viability. This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\% and 4.5\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time. Because the framework assumes only a suitable assay and defined formulation space, it can be adapted to different CPA libraries, objective definitions, and cell lines to accelerate cryopreservation development.

Abstract: We develop a worst-case complexity theory for stochastically preconditioned stochastic gradient descent (SPSGD) and its accelerated variants under heavy-tailed noise, a setting that encompasses widely used adaptive methods such as Adam, RMSProp, and Shampoo. We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest. These results provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical preference for normalization over clipping in large-scale model training.

Abstract: Selecting an optimal classification model requires a robust and comprehensive understanding of the performance of the model. This paper provides a tutorial on the PyCM library, demonstrating its utility in conducting deep-dive evaluations of multi-class classifiers. By examining two different case scenarios, we illustrate how the choice of evaluation metrics can fundamentally shift the interpretation of a model's efficacy. Our findings emphasize that a multi-dimensional evaluation framework is essential for uncovering small but important differences in model performance. However, standard metrics may miss these subtle performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Understanding the internal circuits that language models use to solve tasks remains a central challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.

Abstract: Muon-style optimizers leverage Newton-Schulz (NS) iterations to orthogonalize updates, yielding update geometries that often outperform Adam-series methods. However, this orthogonalization discards magnitude information, rendering training sensitive to step-size hyperparameters and vulnerable to high-energy bursts. To mitigate this, we introduce TrasMuon (\textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{S}caling \textbf{Muon}). TrasMuon preserves the near-isometric geometry of Muon while stabilizing magnitudes through (i) global RMS calibration and (ii) energy-based trust-region clipping. We demonstrate that while reintroducing adaptive scaling improves optimization efficiency, it typically exacerbates instability due to high-energy outliers. TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness.

Abstract: Identifying feature representations in language models is a central task in mechanistic interpretability. Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a sequential test for detecting arbitrary distribution shifts that allows conformal test martingales (CTMs) to work under a fixed, reference-conditional setting. Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.
  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for element selection, a multiplication-free form of dimension reduction that produces a dimension-reduced vector by simply selecting a subset of elements from the input. Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Batch size scheduling (BSS) plays a critical role in large-scale deep learning training, influencing both optimization dynamics and computational efficiency. Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines.

Abstract: Clustering serves as a vital tool for uncovering latent data structures, and achieving both high accuracy and interpretability is essential. To this end, existing methods typically construct binary decision trees by solving mixed-integer nonlinear optimization problems, often leading to significant computational costs and suboptimal solutions. Furthermore, binary decision trees frequently result in excessively deep structures, which makes them difficult to interpret. To mitigate these issues, we propose an interpretable clustering method based on optimal multiway-split decision trees, formulated as a 0-1 integer linear optimization problem. This reformulation renders the optimization problem more tractable compared to existing models. A key feature of our method is the integration of a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for the discretization of continuous variables, allowing for flexible and data-driven branching. Extensive numerical experiments on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of clustering accuracy and interpretability. Our method yields multiway-split decision trees with concise decision rules while maintaining competitive performance across various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: The expanding integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into recommender systems poses critical challenges to evaluation reliability. This paper identifies and investigates a previously overlooked issue: benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommendation. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs are exposed to and potentially memorize benchmark datasets during pre-training or fine-tuning, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that fail to reflect true model performance. To validate this phenomenon, we simulate diverse data leakage scenarios by conducting continued pre-training of foundation models on strategically blended corpora, which include user-item interactions from both in-domain and out-of-domain sources. Our experiments reveal a dual-effect of data leakage: when the leaked data is domain-relevant, it induces substantial but spurious performance gains, misleadingly exaggerating the model's capability. In contrast, domain-irrelevant leakage typically degrades recommendation accuracy, highlighting the complex and contingent nature of this contamination. Our findings reveal that data leakage acts as a critical, previously unaccounted-for factor in LLM-based recommendation, which could impact the true model performance. We release our code at https://github.com/yusba1/LLMRec-Data-Leakage.

Abstract: We study the constrained variant of the \emph{multi-armed bandit} (MAB) problem, in which the learner aims not only at minimizing the total loss incurred during the learning dynamic, but also at controlling the violation of multiple \emph{unknown} constraints, under both \emph{full} and \emph{bandit feedback}. We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints. Specifically, under \emph{full feedback} we propose an algorithm attaining $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ regret and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation, where $C$ quantifies the amount of non-stationarity in the constraints. We then show how to extend these guarantees when only bandit feedback is available for the losses. Finally, when \emph{bandit feedback} is available for the constraints, we design an algorithm achieving $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C)$ {positive} violation and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T}+C\sqrt{T})$ regret.

Abstract: Neighborhood Aggregation Strategy (NAS) is a widely used approach in graph embedding, underpinning both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) methods. However, NAS-based methods are identified to be prone to over-smoothing-the loss of node distinguishability with increased iterations-thereby limiting their effectiveness. This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Algorithmic \emph{replicability} has recently been introduced to address the need for reproducible experiments in machine learning. A \emph{replicable online learning} algorithm is one that takes the same sequence of decisions across different executions in the same environment, with high probability. We initiate the study of algorithmic replicability in \emph{constrained} MAB problems, where a learner interacts with an unknown stochastic environment for $T$ rounds, seeking not only to maximize reward but also to satisfy multiple constraints. Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs. Specifically, we design replicable algorithms whose regret and constraint violation match those of non-replicable ones in terms of $T$. As a key step toward these guarantees, we develop the first replicable UCB-like algorithm for \emph{unconstrained} MABs, showing that algorithms that employ the optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle can be replicable, a result that we believe is of independent interest.

Abstract: Time series chain (TSC) is a recently introduced concept that captures the evolving patterns in large scale time series. Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain. We demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing TSC work in locating unusual evolving patterns through extensive empirical evaluations. We further demonstrate the utility of our work with a real-life manufacturing application from Intel. Our source code is publicly available at the supporting page https://github.com/lizhang-ts/JointTSC .

Abstract: In this work we introduce methods to reduce the computational and memory costs of training deep neural networks. Our approach consists in replacing exact vector-jacobian products by randomized, unbiased approximations thereof during backpropagation. We provide a theoretical analysis of the trade-off between the number of epochs needed to achieve a target precision and the cost reduction for each epoch. We then identify specific unbiased estimates of vector-jacobian products for which we establish desirable optimality properties of minimal variance under sparsity constraints. Finally we provide in-depth experiments on multi-layer perceptrons, BagNets and Visual Transfomers architectures. These validate our theoretical results, and confirm the potential of our proposed unbiased randomized backpropagation approach for reducing the cost of deep learning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models (LLMs) is a cornerstone of modern NLP, yet its growing memory demands (driven by backpropagation and large optimizer States) limit deployment in resource-constrained settings. Zero-order (ZO) methods bypass backpropagation by estimating directional derivatives from forward evaluations, offering substantial memory savings. However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds. Empirically, we validate the approach on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to standard ZO baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive direction sampling is a promising route to make ZO fine-tuning viable at scale. The source code is available at https://github.com/brain-lab-research/zo_ldsd

Abstract: Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization (MSBO) serves as a variant of the traditional Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework applicable to situations involving optimization of an objective black-box function over multiple information sources such as simulations, surrogate models, or real-world experiments. However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been a main driver of recent breakthroughs in large reasoning models. Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) with pre-trained models (PTMs) faces a critical trade-off between efficient adaptation and long-term stability. While analytic learning enables rapid, recursive closed-form updates, its efficacy is often compromised by accumulated errors and feature incompatibility. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic study to dissect the failure modes of PTM-based analytic CIL, identifying representation rigidity as the primary bottleneck. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy. Specifically, we coherently fuse plastic, task-adapted features with a frozen, universal semantic anchor at the feature level through geometric calibration, and leverage cross-modal priors at the decision level to rectify prediction bias. This confluence maintains analytic-learning's extreme efficiency while overcoming its inherent brittleness. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that VILA consistently yields superior performance, particularly in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios. Our framework harmonizes high-fidelity prediction with the simplicity of analytic learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/VILA

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train models through local training and fully decentralized device-to-device (D2D) model exchanges. However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: We propose a parameter-minimal neural architecture for solving differential equations by restricting the hypothesis class to Horner-factorized polynomials, yielding an implicit, differentiable trial solution with only a small set of learnable coefficients. Initial conditions are enforced exactly by construction by fixing the low-order polynomial degrees of freedom, so training focuses solely on matching the differential-equation residual at collocation points. To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise ("spline-like") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling.

Abstract: Data quality is a crucial factor in large language models training. While prior work has shown that models trained on smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform those trained on much larger but noisy or low-quality corpora, systematic methods for industrial-scale data selection in instruction tuning remain underexplored. In this work, we study instruction-tuning data selection through the lens of semantic representation similarity and identify a key limitation of state-of-the-art LLM encoders: they produce highly redundant semantic embeddings. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS), a novel framework with two variants. CRDS-R applies Rademacher random projection followed by concatenation of transformer hidden-layer representations, while CRDS-W employs whitening-based dimensionality reduction to improve representational quality. Experimental results demonstrate that both variants substantially enhance data quality and consistently outperform state-of-the-art representation-based selection methods. Notably, CRDS-W achieves strong performance using only 3.5% of the data, surpassing the full-data baseline by an average of 0.71% across four datasets.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has long been dominated by model-centric approaches that formulate prediction as a single-pass mapping from historical observations to future values. Despite recent progress, such formulations often struggle in complex and evolving settings, largely because most forecasting models lack the ability to autonomously acquire informative evidence, reason about potential future changes, or revise predictions through iterative decision processes. In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1. We hope this work provides a practical step towards further exploration of agentic paradigms for time series modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-Tao/Cast-R1-TS.

Abstract: Repository-level bug localization-the task of identifying where code must be modified to fix a bug-is a critical software engineering challenge. Standard Large Language Modles (LLMs) are often unsuitable for this task due to context window limitations that prevent them from processing entire code repositories. As a result, various retrieval methods are commonly used, including keyword matching, text similarity, and simple graph-based heuristics such as Breadth-First Search. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising alternative due to their ability to model complex, repository-wide dependencies; however, their application has been hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce GREPO, the first GNN benchmark for repository-scale bug localization tasks. GREPO comprises 86 Python repositories and 47294 bug-fixing tasks, providing graph-based data structures ready for direct GNN processing. Our evaluation of various GNN architectures shows outstanding performance compared to established information retrieval baselines. This work highlights the potential of GNNs for bug localization and established GREPO as a foundation resource for future research, The code is available at https://github.com/qingpingmo/GREPO.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a trending paradigm for training reasoning large language models (LLMs). However, due to the autoregressive decoding nature of LLMs, the rollout process becomes the efficiency bottleneck of RL training, consisting of up to 70\% of the total training time. In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training.

Abstract: Most time series foundation models are pretrained by directly predicting future observations, which often yields weakly structured latent representations that capture surface noise rather than coherent and predictable temporal dynamics. In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results demonstrate that constraining models to learn predictable latent dynamics is a principled step toward more robust and reliable time series foundation models.

Abstract: Despite their success, large pretrained vision models remain vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting when adapted to new tasks in class-incremental settings. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for interpreting neural networks by decomposing their activations into sparse sets of human-interpretable features. Recent work has introduced multiple SAE variants and successfully scaled them to frontier models. Despite much excitement, a growing number of negative results in downstream tasks casts doubt on whether SAEs recover meaningful features. To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only $9\%$ of true features despite achieving $71\%$ explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale Transformers efficiently but suffer from expert overlap -- redundant representations across experts and routing ambiguity, resulting in severely underutilized model capacity. While architectural solutions like DeepSeekMoE promote specialization, they require substantial structural modifications and rely solely on intra-layer signals. In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization. Both losses are orthogonal to the standard load-balancing loss and compatible with both the shared-expert architecture in DeepSeekMoE and vanilla top-$k$ MoE architectures. We implement both losses as a drop-in Megatron-LM module. Extensive experiments across pre-training, fine-tuning, and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate consistent task gains, higher expert specialization, and lower-entropy routing; together, these improvements translate into faster inference via more stable expert pathways.

Abstract: Effective exploration is a key challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models: discovering high-quality trajectories within a limited sampling budget from the vast natural language sequence space. Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms GRPO, tree-based methods, and other strong baselines.

Abstract: Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) are emerging as unified models for reasoning over continuous signals in natural language. However, long-context retrieval remains a major limitation: existing models are typically trained and evaluated on short sequences, while real-world time-series sensor streams can span millions of datapoints. This mismatch requires precise temporal localization under strict computational constraints, a regime that is not captured by current benchmarks. We introduce TS-Haystack, a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark comprising ten task types across four categories: direct retrieval, temporal reasoning, multi-step reasoning and contextual anomaly. The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into financial workflows, but evaluation practice has not kept up. Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in residential heat pump (HP) installations, optimizing hot water production in households is essential, yet it faces major technical and scalability challenges. Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.
  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning aims to learn maximally informative representations, but explicit information maximization is hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods like VCReg address this by regularizing first and second-order feature statistics, which cannot fully achieve maximum entropy. We propose Radial-VCReg, which augments VCReg with a radial Gaussianization loss that aligns feature norms with the Chi distribution-a defining property of high-dimensional Gaussians. We prove that Radial-VCReg transforms a broader class of distributions towards normality compared to VCReg and show on synthetic and real-world datasets that it consistently improves performance by reducing higher-order dependencies and promoting more diverse and informative representations.

Abstract: Causal inference, a critical tool for informing business decisions, traditionally relies heavily on structured data. However, in many real-world scenarios, such data can be incomplete or unavailable. This paper presents a framework that leverages transformer-based language models to perform causal inference using unstructured text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce.

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized machine learning across a wide range of domains, from natural language processing to scientific computing. However, their growing deployment in high-stakes applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, autonomous systems, and critical areas of scientific computing including climate modeling, materials discovery, drug discovery, nuclear science, and robotics, necessitates a deeper and more rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. In this work, we critically examine the foundational question: \textitHow trustworthy are transformer models?} We evaluate their reliability through a comprehensive review of interpretability, explainability, robustness against adversarial attacks, fairness, and privacy. We systematically examine the trustworthiness of transformer-based models in safety-critical applications spanning natural language processing, computer vision, and science and engineering domains, including robotics, medicine, earth sciences, materials science, fluid dynamics, nuclear science, and automated theorem proving; highlighting high-impact areas where these architectures are central and analyzing the risks associated with their deployment. By synthesizing insights across these diverse areas, we identify recurring structural vulnerabilities, domain-specific risks, and open research challenges that limit the reliable deployment of transformers.

Abstract: We investigate how formal temporal logic specifications can enhance the safety and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) control in aerospace applications. Using the open source AeroBench F-16 simulation benchmark, we train a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to regulate engine throttle and track commanded airspeed. The control objective is encoded as a Signal Temporal Logic (STL) requirement to maintain airspeed within a prescribed band during the final seconds of each maneuver. To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning promises strong sample efficiency but often underperforms in practice due to compounding model error, unimodal world models that average over multi-modal dynamics, and overconfident predictions that bias learning. We introduce WIMLE, a model-based method that extends Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (IMLE) to the model-based RL framework to learn stochastic, multi-modal world models without iterative sampling and to estimate predictive uncertainty via ensembles and latent sampling. During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern deep learning, yet its core self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic computational complexity and lacks grounding in biological neural computation. We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong capabilities but incur high inference costs due to dense computation and memory access. Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed. Our research advances the limits of training-free approaches for efficient LLM inference, pushing the boundaries of achievable speedup without training.

Abstract: Revealing the underlying causal mechanisms in the real world is crucial for scientific and technological progress. Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets.

Abstract: Data-parallel (DP) training with synchronous all-reduce is a dominant paradigm for full-parameter fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that representations from neural networks are converging to a common statistical model of reality. We show that the existing metrics used to measure representational similarity are confounded by network scale: increasing model depth or width can systematically inflate representational similarity scores. To correct these effects, we introduce a permutation-based null-calibration framework that transforms any representational similarity metric into a calibrated score with statistical guarantees. We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities. Based on these findings, we propose the Aristotelian Representation Hypothesis: representations in neural networks are converging to shared local neighborhood relationships.

Abstract: Scaling laws can be understood from ground-up numerical analysis, where traditional function approximation theory can explain shifts in model architecture choices. GLU variants now dominate frontier LLMs and similar outer-product architectures are prevalent in ranking models. The success of these architectures has mostly been left as an empirical discovery. In this paper, we apply the tools of numerical analysis to expose a key factor: these models have an $x^2$ which enables \emph{asymptotically} faster scaling than MLPs. GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP. This opens the possibility of architecture design from first principles numerical theory to unlock superior scaling in large models. Replication code is available at https://github.com/afqueiruga/divine_scaling.

Abstract: Despite legal mandates for the right to be forgotten, AI operators routinely fail to comply with data deletion requests. While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.

Abstract: The primary focus of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been to study interactions among a fixed number of agents embedded in an environment. However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings. We demonstrate that this framework yields agent teams that adjust their size dynamically to match environmental demands.

Abstract: Sparsity is a well-studied technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs) without compromising performance. In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment. RNM-TD3 remains competitive even at 87.5% sparsity (1:8), while enabling potential training speedups.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to deliver interpretable predictions by routing decisions through a human-understandable concept layer, yet they often suffer reduced accuracy and concept leakage that undermines faithfulness. We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets.

Abstract: Compressed Deep Learning (DL) models are essential for deployment in resource-constrained environments. But their performance often lags behind their large-scale counterparts. To bridge this gap, we propose Alignment Adapter (AlAd): a lightweight, sliding-window-based adapter. It aligns the token-level embeddings of a compressed model with those of the original large model. AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.

Abstract: Orthogonality constraints are ubiquitous in robust and probabilistic machine learning. Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours. As such, POGO sets a milestone to finally exploit orthogonality constraints in ML at scale. A PyTorch implementation of POGO is publicly available at https://github.com/adrianjav/pogo.

Abstract: We present pseudo-differential enhanced physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), an extension of gradient enhancement but in Fourier space. Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise.

Abstract: Deep Learning architectures, and in particular Transformers, are conventionally viewed as a composition of layers. These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.

Abstract: AI alignment is growing in importance, yet current approaches suffer from a critical structural flaw that entangles the safety objectives with the agent's policy. Methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization create opaque, single-use alignment artifacts, which we term Alignment Waste. We propose Interactionless Inverse Reinforcement Learning to decouple alignment artifact learning from policy optimization, producing an inspectable, editable, and model-agnostic reward model. Additionally, we introduce the Alignment Flywheel, a human-in-the-loop lifecycle that iteratively hardens the reward model through automated audits and refinement. This architecture transforms safety from a disposable expense into a durable, verifiable engineering asset.

Atomix tags each call with an epoch, tracks per-resource frontiers, and commits only when progress predicates indicate safety; bufferable effects can be delayed, while externalized effects are tracked and compensated on abort. Across real workloads with fault injection, transactional retry improves task success, while frontier-gated commit strengthens isolation under speculation and contention.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) offers distribution-free marginal coverage guarantees under an exchangeability assumption, but these guarantees can fail if the data distribution shifts. We analyze the use of pseudo-calibration as a tool to counter this performance loss under a bounded label-conditional covariate shift model. Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that our bounds qualitatively track pseudo-calibration behavior and that the source-tuned scheme mitigates coverage degradation under distribution shift while maintaining nontrivial prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyGNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling higher-order relationships among entities. However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs.

Abstract: In machine unlearning, $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning is a popular framework that provides formal guarantees on the effectiveness of the removal of a subset of training data, the forget set, from a trained model. For strongly convex objectives, existing first-order methods achieve $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning, but they only use the forget set to calibrate injected noise, never as a direct optimization signal. In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning (GDL) deals with supervised learning on data domains that go beyond Euclidean structure, such as data with graph or manifold structure. Due to the demand that arises from application-related data, there is a need to identify further topological and geometric structures with which these use cases can be made accessible to machine learning. There are various techniques, such as spectral convolution, that form the basic building blocks for some convolutional neural network-like architectures on non-Euclidean data. In this paper, the concept of spectral convolution on orbifolds is introduced. This provides a building block for making learning on orbifold structured data accessible using GDL. The theory discussed is illustrated using an example from music theory.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs are safeguarded against attempts to extract harmful information via adversarial prompts known as "jailbreaks". Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength ("boundary points"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.

Abstract: We show that AI foundation models that are pretrained on numerical solutions to a diverse corpus of partial differential equations can be adapted and fine-tuned to obtain skillful predictive weather emulators for the Martian atmosphere. We base our work on the Poseidon PDE foundation model for two-dimensional systems. We develop a method to extend Poseidon from two to three dimensions while keeping the pretraining information. Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\% on a held-out year. This shows that PDEs-FMs can not only approximate solutions to (other) PDEs but also anchor models for real-world problems with complex interactions that lack a sufficient amount of training data or a suitable compute budget.

Abstract: Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models.

Abstract: A key challenge in probabilistic regression is ensuring that predictive distributions accurately reflect true empirical uncertainty. Minimizing overall prediction error often encourages models to prioritize informativeness over calibration, producing narrow but overconfident predictions. However, in safety-critical settings, trustworthy uncertainty estimates are often more valuable than narrow intervals. Realizing the problem, several recent works have focused on post-hoc corrections; however, existing methods either rely on weak notions of calibration (such as PIT uniformity) or impose restrictive parametric assumptions on the nature of the error. To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions. For efficient inference with real-valued targets, we introduce a novel characteristic kernel over distributions that can be evaluated in $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ time for empirical distributions of size $n$. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior re-calibration approaches across a diverse set of regression benchmarks and model classes.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), fine-tuning pretrained models has become ubiquitous. Yet the theoretical underpinning remains an open question. A central question is why only a few epochs of fine-tuning are typically sufficient to achieve strong performance on many different tasks. In this work, we approach this question by developing a statistical framework, combining rigorous early stopping theory with the attention-based Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for LLMs, offering new theoretical insights on fine-tuning practices. Specifically, we formally extend classical NTK theory [Jacot et al., 2018] to non-random (i.e., pretrained) initializations and provide a convergence guarantee for attention-based fine-tuning. One key insight provided by the theory is that the convergence rate with respect to sample size is closely linked to the eigenvalue decay rate of the empirical kernel matrix induced by the NTK. We also demonstrate how the framework can be used to explain task vectors for multiple tasks in LLMs. Finally, experiments with modern language models on real-world datasets provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical insights.

Abstract: We study two log-concave sampling problems: constrained sampling and composite sampling. First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to $\exp(-f(x))$ supported on a convex set $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, where $f$ is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for $K$ and a subgradient oracle for $f$, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set.
  Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to $\exp(-f(x)-h(x))$ with closed and convex $f$ and $h$. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with $f$ modeling data fidelity and $h$ encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of $h$ to constrained sampling in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in $\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping $f$ and $h$ separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access (such as subgradient and proximal) can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and $χ^2$ divergences.

Abstract: Posterior inference from pulsar observations in the form of light curves is commonly performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are accurate but computationally expensive. We introduce a framework that accelerates posterior inference while maintaining accuracy by combining learned latent representations with local simulator-guided optimization. A masked U-Net is first pretrained to reconstruct complete light curves from partial observations and to produce informative latent embeddings. Given a query light curve, we identify similar simulated light curves from the simulation bank by measuring similarity in the learned embedding space produced by pretrained U-Net encoder, yielding an initial empirical approximation to the posterior over parameters. This initialization is then refined using a local optimization procedure using hill-climbing updates, guided by a forward simulator, progressively shifting the empirical posterior toward higher-likelihood parameter regions. Experiments on the observed light curve of PSR J0030+0451, captured by NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), show that our method closely matches posterior estimates obtained using traditional MCMC methods while achieving 120 times reduction in inference time (from 24 hours to 12 minutes), demonstrating the effectiveness of learned representations and simulator-guided optimization for accelerated posterior inference.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Commercial insurance underwriting is a labor-intensive process that requires manual review of extensive documentation to assess risk and determine policy pricing. While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems, yet we lack benchmarks that test whether they can coordinate under resource contention. We introduce DPBench, a benchmark based on the Dining Philosophers problem that evaluates LLM coordination across eight conditions that vary decision timing, group size, and communication. Our experiments with GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1 reveal a striking asymmetry: LLMs coordinate effectively in sequential settings but fail when decisions must be made simultaneously, with deadlock rates exceeding 95\% under some conditions. We trace this failure to convergent reasoning, where agents independently arrive at identical strategies that, when executed simultaneously, guarantee deadlock. Contrary to expectations, enabling communication does not resolve this problem and can even increase deadlock rates. Our findings suggest that multi-agent LLM systems requiring concurrent resource access may need external coordination mechanisms rather than relying on emergent coordination. DPBench is released as an open-source benchmark. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/najmulhasan-code/dpbench.

Abstract: Large language models spend most of their inference cost on attention over long contexts, yet empirical behavior suggests that only a small subset of tokens meaningfully contributes to each query. We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\exp(-Ω(Δ/\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.
  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for complex tasks, yet their ability to adapt to individual users remains fundamentally limited. We argue this limitation stems from a critical architectural conflation: current systems treat memory, learning, and personalization as a unified capability rather than three distinct mechanisms requiring different infrastructure, operating on different timescales, and benefiting from independent optimization. We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber-threats demand intrusion detection systems (IDS) that are not only accurate but also interpretable. This paper presented a novel IDS framework that integrated Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to enhance transparency in deep learning models. The framework was evaluated experimentally using the benchmark dataset NSL-KDD, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional IDS and black-box deep learning models. The proposed approach combined Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies in traffic sequences. Our deep learning results showed that both CNN and LSTM reached 0.99 for accuracy, whereas LSTM outperformed CNN at macro average precision, recall, and F-1 score. For weighted average precision, recall, and F-1 score, both models scored almost similarly. To ensure interpretability, the XAI model SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) was incorporated, enabling security analysts to understand and validate model decisions. Some notable influential features were srv_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, and serror_rate for both models, as pointed out by SHAP. We also conducted a trust-focused expert survey based on IPIP6 and Big Five personality traits via an interactive UI to evaluate the system's reliability and usability. This work highlighted the potential of combining performance and transparency in cybersecurity solutions and recommends future enhancements through adaptive learning for real-time threat detection.

Abstract: It is unclear whether strong forecasting performance reflects genuine temporal understanding or the ability to reason under contextual and event-driven conditions. We introduce TemporalBench, a multi-domain benchmark designed to evaluate temporal reasoning behavior under progressively richer informational settings. TemporalBench adopts a four-tier task taxonomy that examines historical structure interpretation, context-free forecasting, contextual temporal reasoning, and event-conditioned prediction across four real-world domains: retail, healthcare, energy, and physical systems. By controlling access to future targets and contextual information, the benchmark enables a diagnostic analysis of whether models can correctly interpret temporal patterns, align them with external context, and adapt predictions when conditions change. Extensive baseline experiments show that strong numerical forecasting accuracy does not reliably translate into robust contextual or event-aware temporal reasoning; instead, existing agent frameworks exhibit fragmented strengths and systematic failure modes that remain largely hidden under forecasting-only benchmarks. The TemporalBench dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TemporalBench, and we additionally provide a public leaderboard at https://huggingface.co/spaces/Melady/TemporalBench_Leaderboard.

Abstract: Prompt design significantly impacts the moral competence and safety alignment of large language models (LLMs), yet empirical comparisons remain fragmented across datasets and models.We introduce ProMoral-Bench, a unified benchmark evaluating 11 prompting paradigms across four LLM families. Using ETHICS, Scruples, WildJailbreak, and our new robustness test, ETHICS-Contrast, we measure performance via our proposed Unified Moral Safety Score (UMSS), a metric balancing accuracy and safety. Our results show that compact, exemplar-guided scaffolds outperform complex multi-stage reasoning, providing higher UMSS scores and greater robustness at a lower token cost. While multi-turn reasoning proves fragile under perturbations, few-shot exemplars consistently enhance moral stability and jailbreak resistance. ProMoral-Bench establishes a standardized framework for principled, cost-effective prompt engineering.

Abstract: Alignment research focuses on making individual AI systems reliable. Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.
  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.
  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly trained and fine-tuned, practitioners need methods to identify which training data drive specific behaviors, particularly unintended ones. Training Data Attribution (TDA) methods address this by estimating datapoint influence. Existing approaches like influence functions are both computationally expensive and attribute based on single test examples, which can bias results toward syntactic rather than semantic similarity. To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data.

Abstract: As AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) increasingly use external tools for high-stakes decisions, a critical reliability question arises: how do errors propagate across sequential tool calls? We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing error accumulation in Model Context Protocol (MCP) agents, proving that cumulative distortion exhibits linear growth and high-probability deviations bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$. This concentration property ensures predictable system behavior and rules out exponential failure modes. We develop a hybrid distortion metric combining discrete fact matching with continuous semantic similarity, then establish martingale concentration bounds on error propagation through sequential tool interactions. Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems.

Abstract: Evaluating moral alignment in agents navigating conflicting, hierarchically structured human norms is a critical challenge at the intersection of AI safety, moral philosophy, and cognitive science. We introduce Morality Chains, a novel formalism for representing moral norms as ordered deontic constraints, and MoralityGym, a benchmark of 98 ethical-dilemma problems presented as trolley-dilemma-style Gymnasium environments. By decoupling task-solving from moral evaluation and introducing a novel Morality Metric, MoralityGym allows the integration of insights from psychology and philosophy into the evaluation of norm-sensitive reasoning. Baseline results with Safe RL methods reveal key limitations, underscoring the need for more principled approaches to ethical decision-making. This work provides a foundation for developing AI systems that behave more reliably, transparently, and ethically in complex real-world contexts.

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are beginning to automate user's tasks across the open web, often with access to user resources such as emails and calendars. Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act "in the wild", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success. Our findings underscore that protecting privacy in web agents is a fundamental challenge, requiring a broader view of "output" that accounts for what agents do on the web, not just what they type. Our datasets and code are available at https://github.com/jrohsc/SPILLage.

Abstract: Humans excel at remembering concrete experiences along spatiotemporal contexts and performing reasoning across those events, i.e., the capacity for episodic memory. In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions.

Abstract: To fulfill user instructions, autonomous web agents must contend with the inherent complexity and volatile nature of real-world websites. Conventional paradigms predominantly rely on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) using static datasets. However, these methods suffer from severe distributional shifts, as offline trajectories fail to capture the stochastic state transitions and real-time feedback of unconstrained wide web environments. In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward. This system effectively mitigates the credit assignment challenge in long-horizon navigation. Notably, our RL-enhanced model achieves a 38.1\% success rate (pass@5) on WebArena, outperforming all existing monolithic baselines. 3) Operator Agent: We introduce a modular agentic framework, namely \textbf{OpAgent}, orchestrating a Planner, Grounder, Reflector, and Summarizer. This synergy enables robust error recovery and self-correction, elevating the agent's performance to a new State-of-the-Art (SOTA) success rate of \textbf{71.6\%}.

Abstract: Agentic AI require persistent memory to store user-specific histories beyond the limited context window of LLMs. Existing memory systems use dense vector databases or knowledge-graph traversal (or hybrid), incurring high retrieval latency and poor storage scalability. We introduce Hippocampus, an agentic memory management system that uses compact binary signatures for semantic search and lossless token-ID streams for exact content reconstruction. Its core is a Dynamic Wavelet Matrix (DWM) that compresses and co-indexes both streams to support ultra-fast search in the compressed domain, thus avoiding costly dense-vector or graph computations. This design scales linearly with memory size, making it suitable for long-horizon agentic deployments. Empirically, our evaluation shows that Hippocampus reduces end-to-end retrieval latency by up to 31$\times$ and cuts per-query token footprint by up to 14$\times$, while maintaining accuracy on both LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws provide a predictable recipe for AI advancement: reducing numerical precision should linearly improve computational efficiency and energy profile (E proportional to bits). In this paper, we demonstrate that this scaling law breaks in the context of multi-hop reasoning. We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice. Our findings suggest that the industry's "smaller-is-better" heuristic is mathematically counterproductive for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose DiffusionRollout, a novel selective rollout planning strategy for autoregressive diffusion models, aimed at mitigating error accumulation in long-horizon predictions of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Building on the recently validated probabilistic approach to PDE solving, we further explore its ability to quantify predictive uncertainty and demonstrate a strong correlation between prediction errors and standard deviations computed over multiple samples-supporting their use as a proxy for the model's predictive confidence. Based on this observation, we introduce a mechanism that adaptively selects step sizes during autoregressive rollouts, improving long-term prediction reliability by reducing the compounding effect of conditioning on inaccurate prior outputs. Extensive evaluation on long-trajectory PDE prediction benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty measure and adaptive planning strategy, as evidenced by lower prediction errors and longer predicted trajectories that retain a high correlation with their ground truths.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter significant performance bottlenecks in long-sequence tasks due to the computational complexity and memory overhead inherent in the self-attention mechanism. To address these challenges, we introduce \textsc{AllMem}, a novel and efficient hybrid architecture that integrates Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with non-linear Test-Time Training (TTT) memory networks. \textsc{AllMem} enables models to effectively scale to ultra-long contexts while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. This approach not only overcomes the representation constraints typical of linear memory models but also significantly reduces the computational and memory footprint during long-sequence inference. Furthermore, we implement a Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning strategy to replace standard attention layers in pre-trained models with memory-augmented sliding window layers. This framework facilitates the efficient transformation of any off-the-shelf pre-trained LLM into an \textsc{AllMem}-based architecture. Empirical evaluations confirm that our 4k window model achieves near-lossless performance on 37k LongBench with a marginal 0.83 drop compared to full attention. Furthermore, on InfiniteBench at a 128k context, our 8k window variant outperforms full attention, which validates the effectiveness of our parameterized memory in mitigating noise and maintaining robust long-range modeling without the prohibitive costs of global attention.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in executing complex tasks through tool use. However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO.

Abstract: In many scientific settings, acquiring complete observations of PDE coefficients and solutions can be expensive, hazardous, or impossible. Recent diffusion-based methods can reconstruct fields given partial observations, but require complete observations for training. We introduce Ambient Physics, a framework for learning the joint distribution of coefficient-solution pairs directly from partial observations, without requiring a single complete observation. The key idea is to randomly mask a subset of already-observed measurements and supervise on them, so the model cannot distinguish "truly unobserved" from "artificially unobserved", and must produce plausible predictions everywhere. Ambient Physics achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Compared with prior diffusion-based methods, it achieves a 62.51$\%$ reduction in average overall error while using 125$\times$ fewer function evaluations. We also identify a "one-point transition": masking a single already-observed point enables learning from partial observations across architectures and measurement patterns. Ambient Physics thus enables scientific progress in settings where complete observations are unavailable.

Abstract: Providing extensive context via prompting is vital for leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\% in F1 score and 40.7\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\times$ compression ratio). Furthermore, PIC significantly expedites the training process. Specifically, when training the 16$\times$ compressor, it surpasses the peak performance of the competitive baseline while effectively reducing the training time by approximately 40\%.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated strong potential in clinical diagnostics, often achieving accuracy comparable to or exceeding that of human experts. A key challenge, however, is that AI reasoning frequently diverges from structured clinical frameworks, limiting trust, interpretability, and adoption. Critical symptoms, pivotal for rapid and accurate decision-making, may be overlooked by AI models even when predictions are correct. Existing post hoc explanation methods provide limited transparency and lack formal guarantees. To address this, we leverage formal abductive explanations, which offer consistent, guaranteed reasoning over minimal sufficient feature sets. This enables a clear understanding of AI decision-making and allows alignment with clinical reasoning. Our approach preserves predictive accuracy while providing clinically actionable insights, establishing a robust framework for trustworthy AI in medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered autonomous agents to handle complex web navigation tasks. While recent studies integrate tree search to enhance long-horizon reasoning, applying these algorithms in web navigation faces two critical challenges: sparse valid paths that lead to inefficient exploration, and a noisy context that dilutes accurate state perception. To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency.

Abstract: Rapidly evolving AI exhibits increasingly strong autonomy and goal-directed capabilities, accompanied by derivative systemic risks that are more unpredictable, difficult to control, and potentially irreversible. However, current AI safety evaluation systems suffer from critical limitations such as restricted risk dimensions and failed frontier risk detection. The lagging safety benchmarks and alignment technologies can hardly address the complex challenges posed by cutting-edge AI models. To bridge this gap, we propose the "ForesightSafety Bench" AI Safety Evaluation Framework, beginning with 7 major Fundamental Safety pillars and progressively extends to advanced Embodied AI Safety, AI4Science Safety, Social and Environmental AI risks, Catastrophic and Existential Risks, as well as 8 critical industrial safety domains, forming a total of 94 refined risk dimensions. To date, the benchmark has accumulated tens of thousands of structured risk data points and assessment results, establishing a widely encompassing, hierarchically clear, and dynamically evolving AI safety evaluation framework. Based on this benchmark, we conduct systematic evaluation and in-depth analysis of over twenty mainstream advanced large models, identifying key risk patterns and their capability boundaries. The safety capability evaluation results reveals the widespread safety vulnerabilities of frontier AI across multiple pillars, particularly focusing on Risky Agentic Autonomy, AI4Science Safety, Embodied AI Safety, Social AI Safety and Catastrophic and Existential Risks. Our benchmark is released at https://github.com/Beijing-AISI/ForesightSafety-Bench. The project website is available at https://foresightsafety-bench.beijing-aisi.ac.cn/.

Abstract: Long-horizon reasoning is a key challenge for autonomous agents, yet existing benchmarks evaluate agents on single tasks in isolation. Real organizational work requires managing many concurrent long-horizon tasks with interleaving, dependencies, and reprioritization. We introduce Multi-Horizon Task Environments (MHTEs): a distinct problem class requiring coherent execution across dozens of interleaved tasks (45+, 500-1500+ steps) within persistent execution contexts spanning hours. We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead. We present CorpGen, an architecture-agnostic framework addressing these failures via hierarchical planning for multi-horizon goal alignment, sub-agent isolation preventing cross-task contamination, tiered memory (working, structured, semantic), and adaptive summarization. CorpGen simulates corporate environments through digital employees with persistent identities and realistic schedules. Across three CUA backends (UFO2, OpenAI CUA, hierarchical) on OSWorld Office, CorpGen achieves up to 3.5x improvement over baselines (15.2% vs 4.3%) with stable performance under increasing load, confirming that gains stem from architectural mechanisms rather than specific CUA implementations. Ablation studies show experiential learning provides the largest gains.

Abstract: Understanding an agent's goals from its behavior is fundamental to aligning AI systems with human intentions. Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments.

Abstract: More than half the global population now carries devices that can run ChatGPT-like language models with no Internet connection and minimal safety oversight -- and hence the potential to promote self-harm, financial losses and extremism among other dangers. Existing safety tools either require cloud connectivity or discover failures only after harm has occurred. Here we show that a large class of potentially dangerous tipping originates at the atomistic scale in such edge AI due to competition for the machinery's attention. This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable sequential decision-making is critical in healthcare, yet reinforcement learning (RL) policies for sepsis treatment optimization remain opaque and difficult to verify. Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in long chain-of-thought reasoning often fail when different knowledge sources provide conflicting signals. We formalize these failures under a unified notion of knowledge conflict, distinguishing input-level objective conflict from process-level effective conflict. Through probing internal representations, we reveal that: (I) Linear Separability: different conflict types are explicitly encoded as linearly separable features rather than entangled; (II) Depth Localization: conflict signals concentrate in mid-to-late layers, indicating a distinct processing stage for conflict encoding; (III) Hierarchical Consistency: aggregating noisy token-level signals along trajectories robustly recovers input-level conflict types; and (IV) Directional Asymmetry: reinforcing the model's implicit source preference under conflict is far easier than enforcing the opposite source. Our findings provide a mechanism-level view of multimodal reasoning under knowledge conflict and enable principled diagnosis and control of long-CoT failures.

Abstract: Failures in large language models (LLMs) are often analyzed from a behavioral perspective, where incorrect outputs in factual question answering are commonly associated with missing knowledge. In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering.

Abstract: AI agents need to plan to achieve complex goals that involve orchestrating perception, sub-goal decomposition, and execution. These plans consist of ordered steps structured according to a Temporal Execution Order (TEO, a directed acyclic graph that ensures each step executes only after its preconditions are satisfied. Existing research on foundational models' understanding of temporal execution is limited to automatically derived annotations, approximations of the TEO as a linear chain, or text-only inputs. To address this gap, we introduce MATEO (MultimodAl Temporal Execution Order), a benchmark designed to assess and improve the temporal reasoning abilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) required for real-world planning. We acquire a high-quality professional multimodal recipe corpus, authored through a standardized editorial process that decomposes instructions into discrete steps, each paired with corresponding images. We collect TEO annotations as graphs by designing and using a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline. Using MATEO, we evaluate six state-of-the-art LVLMs across model scales, varying language context, multimodal input structure, and fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Gradual argumentation is a field of symbolic AI which is attracting attention for its ability to support transparent and contestable AI systems. It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones. Finally, we evaluate our approach both theoretically and experimentally in a robotics setting, and offer recommendations for selecting appropriate gradual semantics in practice.

Abstract: Emergency situations that require the evacuation of urban areas can arise from man-made causes (e.g., terrorist attacks or industrial accidents) or natural disasters, the latter becoming more frequent due to climate change. As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate.

Abstract: Today's leading AI models engage in sophisticated behaviour when placed in strategic competition. They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.
  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.
  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.
  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes.

This limits the evaluation of methods that rely on rich ontological constraints, reasoning or neurosymbolic techniques and ultimately prevents assessing their performance in large-scale, real-world knowledge graphs. In this paper, we present \resource{} the first resource that provides a workflow for extracting datasets including both schema and ground facts, ready for machine learning and reasoning services, along with the resulting curated suite of datasets. The workflow also handles inconsistencies detected when keeping both schema and facts and also leverage reasoning for entailing implicit knowledge. The suite includes newly extracted datasets from KGs with expressive schemas while simultaneously enriching existing datasets with schema information. Each dataset is serialized in OWL making it ready for reasoning services. Moreover, we provide utilities for loading datasets in tensor representations typical of standard machine learning libraries.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a de-facto standard technique to elicit reasoning-like responses from large language models (LLMs), allowing them to spell out individual steps before giving a final answer. While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable.

Abstract: Reasoning about actual causes of observed effects is fundamental to the study of rationality. This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid. Yet, despite extensive research on actual causation, only few recent studies looked into causation with continuous change. Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties.
