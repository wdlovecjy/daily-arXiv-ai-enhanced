Survey of RTLS adoption barriers for small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises", "summary": "Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are central to Industry 4.0 and emerging Industry 5.0, providing the spatiotemporal data required for asset tracking, workflow optimization, safety, and integration with WMS, MES, and digital twins. While large enterprises increasingly deploy RTLSs, adoption among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains limited. This paper examines whether cost and installation complexity are primary barriers to SME adoption. We position RTLSs within the broader Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 landscape and summarize their operational value. We then synthesize evidence from the literature on technical, financial, and organizational constraints, with emphasis on infrastructure requirements, calibration effort, integration with legacy systems, and human factors. To complement this analysis, we report results from an online survey of sixteen manufacturing and technology professionals in Canada and the United States. Respondents report strong perceived value for real-time tracking but identify upfront cost, installation effort, integration difficulty, and reliance on multiple anchor nodes as dominant obstacles. Most indicate acceptable upfront investments below $10,000 and express a clear preference for low-infrastructure deployments with minimized anchor counts. Building on these findings, we outline design directions for SME-focused RTLSs, including wireless and modular architectures, cloud-managed and self-calibrating systems, standardized integration interfaces, and anchor-minimizing or anchor-free localization methods. Overall, the results show that limited SME adoption stems less from insufficient perceived value than from misalignment between current RTLS deployment models and SME resource constraints."}

To that end, we propose a multi-user multi-input single-output (MISO) pixel antenna system, which deploys the pixel antenna at users, and develop the system model including pixel antenna with antenna coding and multi-user beamspace channels. Aiming at maximizing the sum rate performance, we first propose an algorithm to alternatively design the precoding at the transmitter and the antenna coding at users, which explores the performance boundary for the proposed multi-user MISO pixel antenna system. To reduce the computational complexity, we propose a codebook-based antenna coding design algorithm, where the antenna coder is online optimized from an offline codebook. To further enhance the computation efficiency, we propose a hierarchical codebook-based antenna coding design that uses a multi-layer hierarchical search to achieve a better performance-complexity trade-off. Simulation results show that, adopting the proposed algorithms, the multi-user MISO pixel antenna system can always outperform conventional multi-user MISO systems with fixed antennas. More importantly, results validate that the proposed (hierarchical) codebook-based algorithms can significantly reduce the computational complexity while maintaining a satisfactory sum rate performance."}

However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field. All code and implementation details are publicly available at github.com/tiagobrogueira/Causal-Discovery-In-Exchangeable-Data."}

One representative of use cases is crowd flow estimation on outdoor streets. However, most existing studies have focused on indoor environments or vehicles, and demonstrations of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE base station remain limited. This study addresses this use case and proposes an analysis of a crowd flow estimation method using Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) obtained from a commercial LTE base station. Specifically, pedestrian counts derived from a camera-based object recognition algorithm were associated with the variance of RSRP. The features obtained from the variance were quantitatively evaluated by combining a CatBoost regression model with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. Through this investigation, we clarified that an optimal variance window size for RSRP is 0.1 to 0.2 seconds and that enlarging the counting area increased the features obtained from the variance of RSRP, for machine learning. Consequently, this study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of outdoor crowd flow estimation using commercial LTE, while also revealing the characteristic behavior of variance window size and counting area size in feature design."}

The large aperture of ELAA introduces spatial non-stationarity, where far-apart users have significantly distinct visibility at the antennas, thereby reducing inter-user interference. This insight motivates our novel pilot scheme to group users with distinct visibility regions to share the same frequency subcarriers for channel estimation, so that more users can be served with reduced pilot overhead. Specifically, the proposed pilot scheme employs frequency-division multiplexing for inter-group channel estimation, while intra-group users -- benefiting from strong spatial orthogonality -- are distinguished by shifted cyclic codes, similar to code-division multiplexing. Additionally, we introduce a sub-array structured ELAA, where each sub-array is a traditional MIMO array and treated as spatial stationary, while the distances between sub-arrays can be significantly larger to achieve an expanded aperture. The channel support for sub-arrays features clustered sparsity in the antenna-delay domain and is modeled by a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov random field (MRF). Based on this, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation algorithm within a turbo Bayesian inference framework that incorporates the 2-D MRF prior model. Simulations show that the proposed scheme and algorithm allow the XL-MIMO system to support more users, and deliver superior channel estimation performance."}

To achieve a balance between robustness and estimation accuracy, we formulate the adversarial defense as a joint reconstruction task and introduce a tailored joint loss function. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with three state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, the proposed T-ADD significantly mitigates the adverse effects of widely used adversarial attacks, leading to notable improvements in the adversarial robustness of the DOA model."}

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $κ=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps. While NAG remains faster on well-conditioned problems, HB-SGE provides a robust alternative with speedup over SGD across diverse landscapes, requiring only $O(d)$ memory overhead and the same hyperparameters as standard momentum."}

However, ensuring secure information transmission while maintaining high-quality sensing performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate an integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) system, in which a base station (BS) simultaneously serves multiple downlink users and senses malicious targets that may act as both potential eavesdroppers (Eves) and wardens. We propose a novel symbol-level precoding (SLP)-based waveform design for ISCC that achieves covert communication intrinsically, without requiring additional transmission resources such as artificial noise. The proposed design integrates symbol shaping to enhance reliability for legitimate users and noise shaping to obscure transmission activities from the targets. For imperfect channel state information (CSI), the framework incorporates bounded uncertainty models for user channels and target angles, yielding a more robust design. The resulting ISCC waveform optimization problem is non-convex; to address this, we develop a low-complexity proximal distance algorithm (PDA) with closed-form updates under both PSK and QAM modulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior covertness and sensing-communication performance with negligible degradation compared to traditional beamforming and conventional SLP approaches without noise-shaping mechanisms."}

However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$.

We show that the same probes predict demographics from implicit cues: names activate census-aligned gender and race representations, while occupations trigger representations correlated with real-world workforce statistics. These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation. We demonstrate that these implicit demographic representations actively shape downstream behavior, such as career recommendations.

Traditional mechanistic models struggle with empirical parameter variability, while purely data-driven models lack physical consistency and rigorous uncertainty quantification (UQ). This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual). Crucially, we implement a full UQ methodology by decomposing the total predictive variance (sigma2_total) into model uncertainty (epistemic, from GPR's posterior variance) and input uncertainty (aleatoric, analytically propagated via the Delta method for multi-variate correlated inputs). Leveraging the inherent strength of GPR in low-data regimes, the model, trained on a meagre 120 data points, achieved a state-of-the-art Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.26% and an R2 of 0.999 on the independent test data, validating a truly robust and reliable surrogate model for advanced FO process optimization and digital twin development."}

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data."}

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities."}

To address this challenge, multimodal time series forecasting methods which incorporate additional data modalities, mainly text data, alongside time series data have been explored. In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines."}

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.\n  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.\n  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.\n  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations."}

We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step. The transformation is reversible, i.e. given a graph the string can be produced and vice versa. The proposed representation is compact and it maintains the local structural patterns of the graph.

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios."}

We introduce TAFAP (Trajectory Alignment via Fine-tuning with Adversarial Perturbations), the first method to successfully achieve effective TDP by controlling the entire training trajectory. Unlike snapshot-based methods whose protective influence is easily diluted as training progresses, TAFAP employs trajectory-matching inspired by dataset distillation to enforce persistent, verifiable transformations throughout fine-tuning. We validate our method through extensive experiments, demonstrating the first successful targeted transformation in diffusion models with simultaneous control over both identity and visual patterns. TAFAP significantly outperforms existing TDP attempts, achieving robust redirection toward target concepts while maintaining high image quality. This work enables verifiable safeguards and provides a new framework for controlling and tracing alterations in diffusion model outputs."}

While deep learning models can express confidence in their predictions, they often suffer from poor calibration, a cognitive bias where expressed confidence does not reflect true competence. Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity)."}

This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual).

In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks.

This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction.

However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture.

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise."}

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog \"Bayesian Machines\" operating at inherently low precision."}

The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context."}

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."}

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers."}

However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets. The method offers a scalable solution for automated playtesting, game balancing, human-like behavior simulation, and replacing disconnected players in online games."}

Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date."}

The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline. Experiment results with the real world market data such as crude oil price and exchange rates demonstrate that AIR effectively modulates the behavior of the time series model using textual inputs, significantly enhancing forecasting accuracy in various time series forecasting tasks."}

This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.\n  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.\n  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.\n  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations."}

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation.

However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory.

Figueiredo"], "title": "LxCIM: a new rank-based binary classifier performance metric invariant to local exchange of classes", "comment": "28 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Binary classification is one of the oldest, most prevalent, and studied problems in machine learning. However, the metrics used to evaluate model performance have received comparatively little attention. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) has long been a standard choice for model comparison. Despite its advantages, AUROC is not always ideal, particularly for problems that are invariant to local exchange of classes (LxC), a new form of metric invariance introduced in this work. To address this limitation, we propose LxCIM (LxC-invariant metric), which is not only rank-based and invariant under local exchange of classes, but also intuitive, logically consistent, and always computable, while enabling more detailed analysis through the cumulative accuracy-decision rate curve. Moreover, LxCIM exhibits clear theoretical connections to AUROC, accuracy, and the area under the accuracy-decision rate curve (AUDRC). These relationships allow for multiple complementary interpretations: as a symmetric form of AUROC, a rank-based analogue of accuracy, or a more representative and more interpretable variant of AUDRC. Finally, we demonstrate the direct applicability of LxCIM to the bivariate causal discovery problem (which exhibits invariance to local exchange of classes) and show how it addresses the acknowledged limitations of existing metrics used in this field.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data. These results position SAEs as a versatile tool for unstructured data analysis and highlight the neglected importance of interpreting models through their data."}

We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \\textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \\textit{content-target} and \\textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines."}

The approach preserves interpretability through a parametric linear component for covariates of primary interest, while a nonparametric DNN component captures complex time-covariate interactions among nuisance variables. We refer to the method as FLEXI-Haz, a flexible hazard model with a partially linear structure. In contrast to existing DNN approaches for partially linear Cox models, FLEXI-Haz does not rely on the proportional hazards assumption. We establish theoretical guarantees: the neural network component attains minimax-optimal convergence rates based on composite Holder classes, and the linear estimator is root-n consistent, asymptotically normal, and semiparametrically efficient. Extensive simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that FLEXI-Haz provides accurate estimation of the linear effect, offering a principled and interpretable alternative to modern methods based on proportional hazards. Code for implementing FLEXI-Haz, as well as scripts for reproducing data analyses and simulations, is available at: https://github.com/AsafBanana/FLEXI-Haz"}

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches."}

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets. We find that Agile Deliberation achieves 7.5% higher F1 scores than automated decomposition baselines and more than 3% higher than manual deliberation, while participants reported clearer conceptual understanding and lower cognitive effort."}

Shields", "Lukáš Novák"], "title": "Physics-informed Polynomial Chaos Expansion with Enhanced Constrained Optimization Solver and D-optimal Sampling", "comment": null, "summary": "Physics-informed polynomial chaos expansions (PC$^2$) provide an efficient physically constrained surrogate modeling framework by embedding governing equations and other physical constraints into the standard data-driven polynomial chaos expansions (PCE) and solving via the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. This approach improves the physical interpretability of surrogate models while achieving high computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the performance and efficiency of PC$^2$ can still be degraded with high-dimensional parameter spaces, limited data availability, or unrepresentative training data. To address this problem, this study explores two complementary enhancements to the PC$^2$ framework. First, a numerically efficient constrained optimization solver, straightforward updating of Lagrange multipliers (SULM), is adopted as an alternative to the conventional KKT solver. The SULM method significantly reduces computational cost when solving physically constrained problems with high-dimensionality and derivative boundary conditions that require a large number of virtual points. Second, a D-optimal sampling strategy is utilized to select informative virtual points to improve the stability and achieve the balance of accuracy and efficiency of the PC$^2$. The proposed methods are integrated into the PC$^2$ framework and evaluated through numerical examples of representative physical systems governed by ordinary or partial differential equations. The results demonstrate that the enhanced PC$^2$ has better comprehensive capability than standard PC$^2$, and is well-suited for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification tasks."}
