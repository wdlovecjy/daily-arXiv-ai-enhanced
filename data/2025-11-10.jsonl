Reject-option\nprediction addresses this by allowing the model to abstain when prediction\nuncertainty is high. Traditional reject-option approaches focus solely on\naleatoric uncertainty, an assumption valid only when large training data makes\nthe epistemic uncertainty negligible. However, in many practical scenarios,\nlimited data makes this assumption unrealistic. This paper introduces the\nepistemic reject-option predictor, which abstains in regions of high epistemic\nuncertainty caused by insufficient data. Building on Bayesian learning, we\nredefine the optimal predictor as the one that minimizes expected regret -- the\nperformance gap between the learned model and the Bayes-optimal predictor with\nfull knowledge of the data distribution. The model abstains when the regret for\na given input exceeds a specified rejection cost. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst principled framework that enables learning predictors capable of\nidentifying inputs for which the training data is insufficient to make reliable\ndecisions."}

We introduce\nreal-time reasoning as a new problem formulation for agents in evolving\nenvironments and build Real-Time Reasoning Gym to demonstrate it. We study two\nparadigms for deploying language models in agents: (1) reactive agents, which\nemploy language models with bounded reasoning computation for rapid responses,\nand (2) planning agents, which allow extended reasoning computation for complex\nproblems. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art models struggle with\nmaking logical and timely judgments in either paradigm.

In particular,\nif the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL\ndivergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is\nbounded by $A_1 \\epsilon + A_2 \\epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$\ndepend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,\nthis bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers\nunder the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves\nnearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our\nresults make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of\ndiffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and\nlearned velocities corroborate our theory."}

We propose a topological data analysis (TDA)-based framework,\nnamed Topological Prototype Selector (TPS), for selecting representative\nsubsets (prototypes) from large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nTPS on simulated data under different data intrinsic characteristics, and\ncompare TPS against other currently used prototype selection methods in real\ndata settings. In all simulated and real data settings, TPS significantly\npreserves or improves classification performance while substantially reducing\ndata size. These contributions advance both algorithmic and geometric aspects\nof prototype learning and offer practical tools for parallelized,\ninterpretable, and efficient classification."}

It starts with each data point as its centroid and\niteratively merges them. Despite its advantages, this method can fail when\ndealing with data exhibiting linearly non-separable or non-convex structures.\nTo mitigate the limitations, we propose a kernelized extension of the convex\nclustering method. This approach projects the data points into a Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using a feature map, enabling convex clustering in\nthis transformed space. This kernelization not only allows for better handling\nof complex data distributions but also produces an embedding in a\nfinite-dimensional vector space. We provide a comprehensive theoretical\nunderpinnings for our kernelized approach, proving algorithmic convergence and\nestablishing finite sample bounds for our estimates. The effectiveness of our\nmethod is demonstrated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nclustering techniques. This work marks a significant advancement in the field,\noffering an effective solution for clustering in non-linear and non-convex data\nscenarios."}

Nevertheless, training these\nmodels on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited\naccuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling\nand weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in\nregions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive\nweighting component balances the convergence rate across training points.\nNumerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only\nadaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate\npredictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method\nemphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem\ndependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently\nimproves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust\napproach for solving PDEs with PINNs."}
