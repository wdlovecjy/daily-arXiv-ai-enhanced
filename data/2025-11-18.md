Motivation: 准确的死亡率建模对精算科学和公共卫生至关重要，特别是心理健康成为影响人口结果的重要因素。需要整合心理健康监测数据来识别风险区域和脆弱人群。

Method: 使用贝叶斯层次模型，应用条件自回归结构分析2010-2023年美国县级死亡率和自杀率，结合空间时间趋势、心理健康监测数据和社会经济指标。

Result: 发现教育水平、房价、婚姻率、种族构成、家庭规模和心理健康不佳天数与自杀率显著相关；心理健康指标对年轻人群死亡率影响最强；空间时间相关性显示明显的区域聚类和趋势一致性。

Conclusion: 整合心理健康监测数据到死亡率模型中能更好识别新兴风险区域和脆弱人群，有助于公共卫生政策制定、资源分配和针对性干预，减少美国社区间的死亡率和自杀差异。

Abstract: Accurate mortality modeling is central to actuarial science and public health, especially as mental health emerges as a significant factor in population outcomes. This paper develops and applies a Bayesian hierarchical model to analyze U.S. county-level mortality and suicide rates from 2010 to 2023. Applying a conditional autoregressive (CAR) structure to each combination of sex and age grouping, the model captures spatial and temporal trends while incorporating mental health surveillance data and socio-economic indicators. We first assess socio-economic covariates in predicting suicide. While the results vary considerably by age and sex, we find that the county-wide levels of educational attainment, housing prices, marriage rates, racial composition, household size, and poor mental health days all have significant relationships with suicide rates. We next consider the impact of various mental health indicators on all-cause and suicide-specific mortality and find that the strongest effects are observed in younger populations. The spatial and temporal correlation structures reveal substantial regional clustering and time-consistent trends in both all-cause mortality and suicide rates, supporting the use of spatio-temporal methods. Our findings highlight the value of integrating mental health surveillance data into mortality models to better identify emerging risk areas and vulnerable populations. This approach has the potential to inform public health policy, resource allocation, and targeted interventions aimed at reducing disparities in mortality and suicide across U.S. communities.
