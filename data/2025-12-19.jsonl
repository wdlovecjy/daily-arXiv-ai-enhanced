Preregistered at OSF on Nov 14, 2025 (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/BMVP3). Includes comparative analysis with OpenAI's 'Confessions' paper (Dec 3, 2025)", "summary": "Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk."}

To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant \"Success Gap\": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a \"Pull-based\" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard \"Push-based\" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests.

It is more sample efficient than alternatives due to its ability to make use of prior information about the integrand through a Gaussian process. We show this through theory, deriving a convergence rate significantly faster than Monte Carlo in a broad range of settings. We also demonstrate empirically that our proposed method does indeed require fewer samples on several synthetic settings as well as for parameter estimation for Conway-Maxwell-Poisson and Potts models."}

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise."}

This study aims to develop and validate a joint model (JM) using longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements to predict the risk of rehospitalization or death in HF patients. We analyzed real-world data from the TriNetX database, including patients with an incident HF diagnosis between 2016 and 2022. The final selected cohort included 1,804 patients. A Bayesian joint modeling framework was developed to link patient-specific NT-proBNP trajectories to the risk of a composite endpoint (HF rehospitalization or all-cause mortality) within a 180-day window following hospital discharge. The model's performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed with the Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and Integrated Calibration Index (ICI). The joint model demonstrated a strong predictive advantage over a benchmark static model, particularly when making updated predictions at later time points (180-360 days). A joint model trained on patients with more frequent NT-proBNP measurements achieved the highest accuracy. The main joint model showed excellent calibration, suggesting its risk estimates are reliable. These findings suggest that modeling the full trajectory of NT-proBNP with a joint modeling framework enables more accurate and dynamic risk assessment compared to static, single-timepoint methods. This approach supports the development of adaptive clinical decision-support tools for personalized HF management."}

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF."}

We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data."}

We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability.

Consequently, a disjoint fractional delay-Doppler estimation algorithm is derived, and a reduced-complexity equalization method based on the Landweber iteration, which exploits intrinsic channel structure, is proposed.

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy.

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

This paper proposes WeMusic-Agent, a training framework for efficient LLM-based conversational music recommendation. By integrating the knowledge internalization and agentic boundary learning, the framework aims to teach the model to intelligently decide when to leverage internalized knowledge and when to call specialized tools (e.g., music retrieval APIs, music recommendation systems). Under this framework, we present WeMusic-Agent-M1, an agentic model that internalizes extensive musical knowledge via continued pretraining on 50B music-related corpus while acquiring the ability to invoke external tools when necessary. Additionally, considering the lack of open-source benchmarks for conversational music recommendation, we also construct a benchmark for personalized music recommendations derived from real-world data in WeChat Listen. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions, including relevance, personalization, and diversity of the recommendations. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that WeMusic-Agent achieves significant improvements over existing models."}

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise.

In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks.

This tutorial introduces the method, explaining how it transforms experimental data into compact physical laws that reveal compact dimensional invariance between variables. The approach combines classical dimensional analysis with modern machine learning techniques. Starting from measurements of physical quantities, the method identifies the fundamental ways to combine variables into dimensionless groups, then uses neural networks to discover which combinations best predict the experimental output. A key innovation is a regularization technique that encourages the learned coefficients to take simple, interpretable values like integers or half-integers, making the discovered laws both accurate and physically meaningful. We systematically investigate how measurement noise and discrete sampling affect the discovery process, demonstrating that the regularization approach provides robustness to experimental uncertainties. The method successfully handles cases with single or multiple dimensionless numbers, revealing how different but equivalent representations can capture the same underlying physics. Despite recent progress, key challenges remain, including managing the computational cost of identifying multiple dimensionless groups, understanding the influence of data characteristics, automating the selection of relevant input variables, and developing user-friendly tools for experimentalists.

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows."}

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.\n  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models."}

We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B.

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation."}

However, published studies often list the predictors they use (for example age, diagnosis codes, location). Privacy laws increasingly regulate such data types. We use published decision-tree papers as a proxy for real-world use of legally governed data. We compile a corpus of decision-tree studies and assign each reported predictor to a regulated data category (for example health data, biometric identifiers, children's data, financial attributes, location traces, and government IDs). We then link each category to specific excerpts in European Union and United States privacy laws. We find that many reported predictors fall into regulated categories, with the largest shares in healthcare and clear differences across industries. We analyze prevalence, industry composition, and temporal patterns, and summarize regulation-aligned timing using each framework's reference year. Our evidence supports privacy-preserving methods and governance checks, and can inform ML practice beyond decision trees."}

Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS."}

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training."}

At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur."}

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity."}

While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting."}

Cube drawings are modeled as graphs with node features encoding spatial coordinates, local graphlet-based topology, and angular geometry, which are processed using graph neural networks and fused with age, education, and NPT features in a late-fusion model. Experimental results show that graph-based representations provide a strong unimodal baseline and substantially outperform pixel-based convolutional models, while multimodal integration further improves performance and robustness to class imbalance.

By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks."}

TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\\mathbf{n}^{\\top}\\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems.

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers.

However, existing research faces two limitations: (1) the high complexity of optimizing water-nitrogen combinations during crop growth and poor yield optimization results; and (2) the difficulty in quantifying mild stress signals and the delayed feedback, which results in less precise dynamic regulation of water and nitrogen and lower resource utilization efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a Nested Dual-Agent Reinforcement Learning (NDRL) method. The parent agent in NDRL identifies promising macroscopic irrigation and fertilization actions based on projected cumulative yield benefits, reducing ineffective explorationwhile maintaining alignment between objectives and yield. The child agent's reward function incorporates quantified Water Stress Factor (WSF) and Nitrogen Stress Factor (NSF), and uses a mixed probability distribution to dynamically optimize daily strategies, thereby enhancing both yield and resource efficiency. We used field experiment data from 2023 and 2024 to calibrate and validate the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) to simulate real-world conditions and interact with NDRL. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the best baseline, the simulated yield increased by 4.7% in both 2023 and 2024, the irrigation water productivity increased by 5.6% and 5.1% respectively, and the nitrogen partial factor productivity increased by 6.3% and 1.0% respectively. Our method advances the development of cotton irrigation and nitrogen fertilization, providing new ideas for addressing the complexity and precision issues in agricultural resource management and for sustainable agricultural development."}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA reduce this cost by adding small low-rank updates to frozen model weights. However, these methods restrict the training to a limited subspace, which can sometimes reduce performance.\n  For Small Language Models (SLMs), where efficiency gains matter even more, we introduce AdaGradSelect, an adaptive method that selects which transformer blocks to update based on gradients.\n  Early observations showed that updating only the transformer blocks with the highest gradient norms can achieve performance close to full fine-tuning. Building on this insight, AdaGradSelect adaptively chooses which blocks to train. It uses a combination of Dirichlet-based sampling, which depends on how frequently blocks were updated in the past, and an epsilon-greedy exploration strategy. This lets the method explore different blocks in early training and gradually focus on the most important ones in later epochs.\n  Experiments show that AdaGradSelect trains about 12 percent faster and uses 35 percent less GPU memory while delivering performance very close to full fine-tuning. On the GSM8K dataset, it outperforms LoRA (rank 256) by about 3 percent on average across models such as Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA3.2-1B, and Phi4-mini-3.8B. It also achieves similar accuracy on the MATH dataset. Overall, AdaGradSelect provides a more effective and resource-efficient alternative to traditional fine-tuning methods."}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."}

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation."}

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication.

Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data.

Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*."}

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

On a test dataset of 19,873 URLs, the ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 99.819 percent, precision of 100 percent, recall of 99.635 percent, and ROC-AUC of 99.947 percent. Through a FastAPI-based service with an intuitive user interface, the suggested system has been utilised to offer real-time detection. In contrast, the results demonstrate that the suggested solution performs better than individual models; LightGBM contributes 40 percent and character-CNN contributes 60 percent to the final prediction. The suggested method maintains extremely low false positive rates while doing a good job of identifying contemporary phishing techniques.

We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24."}

However, these mechanisms lack theoretical grounding and cannot support context-aware selection from latent state dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose KOSS, a Kalman-optimal Selective State Space model that formulates selection as latent state uncertainty minimization. Derived from estimation theory, KOSS adopts a continuous-time latent update driven by a Kalman gain that dynamically modulates information propagation based on content and context, enabling a closed-loop, context-aware selectivity mechanism. To ensure stable computation and near-linear scalability, KOSS employs global spectral differentiation for frequency-domain derivative estimation, along with a segment-wise scan for hardware-efficient processing. On a selective copying task with distractors, KOSS achieves over 79\\% accuracy while baselines drop below 20\\%, demonstrating robust context-aware selection. Furthermore, across nine long-term forecasting benchmarks, KOSS reduces MSE by 2.92--36.23\\% and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and stability. To assess real-world applicability, a case study on secondary surveillance radar (SSR) tracking confirms KOSS's robustness under irregular intervals and noisy conditions and demonstrates its effectiveness in real-world applications. Finally, supplementary experiments verify Kalman gain convergence and the frequency response of spectral differentiation, providing theoretical support for the proposed closed-loop design."}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components."}

These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system."}

One of the applications of the IoT is in the field of medicine, which is called the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer categorized as a hematic disease. It usually begins in the bone marrow due to the overproduction of immature White Blood Cells (WBCs or leukocytes). Since it has a high rate of spread to other body organs, it is a fatal disease if not diagnosed and treated early. Therefore, for identifying cancerous (ALL) cells in medical diagnostic laboratories, blood, as well as bone marrow smears, are taken by pathologists. However, manual examinations face limitations due to human error risk and time-consuming procedures. So, to tackle the mentioned issues, methods based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), capable of identifying cancer from non-cancer tissue, seem vital. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the most efficient machine learning (ML) methods. These techniques employ multiple layers to extract higher-level features from the raw input. In this paper, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied along with a new type of classifier, Higher Order Singular Value Decomposition (HOSVD), to categorize ALL and normal (healthy) cells from microscopic blood images. We employed the model on IoMT structure to identify leukemia quickly and safely. With the help of this new leukemia classification framework, patients and clinicians can have real-time communication. The model was implemented on the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database (ALL-IDB2) and achieved an average accuracy of %98.88 in the test step."}

Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available."}

SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning."}

In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets."}

For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis."}

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise."}
