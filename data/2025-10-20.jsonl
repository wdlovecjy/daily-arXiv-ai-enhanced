Yet\nmost LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success\ncriteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving\nuncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of\nthe same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which\nLMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer\nreliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains\npoorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an\nextensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation\ntasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background\ninformation and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these\npriors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to\nsamples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we\nfind that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.\nPerformance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the\nmodel, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning\neffort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging\nevaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are\nbetter at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty."}

Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This\nhighlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce\nefficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents.

The core\nidea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a\ndata-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal\noperator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from\nthe empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest\nfeq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional\nsubspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse\nstructure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and\nre-normalizing yields a valid PMF.\n  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the\ncomputation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support\ntimes the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a\npractical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an\northogonal-series risk estimate, so the method \"just works\" with minimal\ntuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves\ncoarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to\nlogspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has\nknown failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities).

This raises a fundamental\nquestion: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this\nvariation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses\n(\"if-then\" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via\ncross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition\nprobabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its\nsemantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key\ndiscovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their\ninternal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness\nlevels, becoming highly distinct for \"strict\" versus \"noisy\" rules. In\ncontrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution\nregardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the\nSoundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon\nDivergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that\nSAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical\nlaw (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)\nand scales (0.5B-14B).

However, in\nmodern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an\noptimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward\nscale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,\ndegrading $\\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay\nscaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,\nthe singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width\nscaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as\n$\\sqrt{\\eta/\\lambda}\\cdot d^{0.75}$.

Our benchmark\nfocuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and\nfeatures fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.\nWe assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini\noutperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like\nDeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For\nchallenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,\nshowing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a\nvaluable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain."}

Code: https://github.com/ltjed/freephdlabor", "summary": "The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for\nscience suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed\nworkflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context\nmanagement that hinders long-horizon research. We present\n\\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring\n\\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a\n\\coloremph{\\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --\nusers can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific\nrequirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including\n\\textit{automatic context compaction}, \\textit{workspace-based communication}\nto prevent information degradation, \\textit{memory persistence} across\nsessions, and \\textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These\nfeatures collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run\nattempts into \\textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on\nprior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the\narchitectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable\nco-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of\nautomated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy\ninteractive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --\nfrom ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts."}

Typically a single VAE is used and\ndisentangled representations are sought in its continuous latent space. Here we\nexplore a different approach by using discrete latents to combine\nVAE-representations of individual sources. The combination is done based on an\nexplicit model for source combination, and we here use a linear combination\nmodel which is well suited, e.g., for acoustic data. We formally define such a\nmulti-stream VAE (MS-VAE) approach, derive its inference and learning\nequations, and we numerically investigate its principled functionality. The\nMS-VAE is domain-agnostic, and we here explore its ability to separate sources\ninto different streams using superimposed hand-written digits, and mixed\nacoustic sources in a speaker diarization task. We observe a clear separation\nof digits, and on speaker diarization we observe an especially low rate of\nmissed speakers. Numerical experiments further highlight the flexibility of the\napproach across varying amounts of supervision and training data."}

Rodrigues"], "title": "Error analysis of a compositional score-based algorithm for simulation-based inference", "comment": null, "summary": "Simulation-based inference (SBI) has become a widely used framework in\napplied sciences for estimating the parameters of stochastic models that best\nexplain experimental observations. A central question in this setting is how to\neffectively combine multiple observations in order to improve parameter\ninference and obtain sharper posterior distributions. Recent advances in\nscore-based diffusion methods address this problem by constructing a\ncompositional score, obtained by aggregating individual posterior scores within\nthe diffusion process. While it is natural to suspect that the accumulation of\nindividual errors may significantly degrade sampling quality as the number of\nobservations grows, this important theoretical issue has so far remained\nunexplored. In this paper, we study the compositional score produced by the\nGAUSS algorithm of Linhart et al. (2024) and establish an upper bound on its\nmean squared error in terms of both the individual score errors and the number\nof observations. We illustrate our theoretical findings on a Gaussian example,\nwhere all analytical expressions can be derived in a closed form."}
