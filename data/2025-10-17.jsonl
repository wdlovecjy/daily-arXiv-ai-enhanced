We propose a\nlightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,\nhumidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage\nsites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified\nencoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37\ntraining samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality\ncomplementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our\nmodel achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal\narchitectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.\nAblation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only\nreaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic\nhyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\\tau}\n=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy\ncompared to other {\\tau} values ({\\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\\tau} =0.9:\n61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with\ncontrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce\nheritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-\nservation decision support systems."}

Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables\nbetter decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug\ndoses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly\ndone from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on\nthe entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets.

Even when\nfine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety\nbehaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned\nmodels. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework\nfor preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key\ncomponents: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.\nFirst, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and\nsafety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value\ndecomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant\nones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated\nsafety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts\nadapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby\nmaintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained\nmodels on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves\nsuperior performance over existing methods.

Today's\napplications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a\nshift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as\nthe Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools\nby including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the\nprompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a\ngrowing problem: prompt bloating.

To address these challenges, in this\nstudy, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.\nConcretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into\ntheir corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before\nlinear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,\nwhich accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.\nAs a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and\nredundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task\nvector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts\nacross models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by\noptimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification\nby our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task\nvector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,\ntasks, and model architectures."}

To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression\nfor relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this\nto constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to\nformally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show\nthat to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to\ncurve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical\npredictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the\ngeometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking\nflatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat\nregions where the model is confidently wrong.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return.

We conduct an extensive computational study on\nstate-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that\nchallenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning.

Yearly features, such as annual totals,\nquarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first\nforecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and\nneighboring-district lags.

As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for\nreliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural\nand symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping\nlow-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning\ninfers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior\nknowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the\nconcepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning\nShortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the\nconcepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's\nexplanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore\nreliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless\nconcept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the\nliterature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and\npractitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview\naddresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing\ntheir causes and consequences in intuitive terms.

Local causal\ndiscovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local\nneighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically\nsuboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments\nDiscovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines\nthe computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality\nof global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the\ntargets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local\ninformation.
