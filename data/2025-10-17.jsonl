This study develops long-term\nforecasts of monthly rainfall across 19 districts of West Bengal using a\ncentury-scale dataset spanning 1900-2019. Daily rainfall records are aggregated\ninto monthly series, resulting in 120 years of observations for each district.\nThe forecasting task involves predicting the next 108 months (9 years,\n2011-2019) while accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions\namong districts. To address the nonlinear and complex structure of rainfall\ndynamics, we propose a hierarchical modeling framework that combines\nregression-based forecasting of yearly features with multi-layer perceptrons\n(MLPs) for monthly prediction. Yearly features, such as annual totals,\nquarterly proportions, variability measures, skewness, and extremes, are first\nforecasted using regression models that incorporate both own lags and\nneighboring-district lags. These forecasts are then integrated as auxiliary\ninputs into an MLP model, which captures nonlinear temporal patterns and\nspatial dependencies in the monthly series. The results demonstrate that the\nhierarchical regression-MLP architecture provides robust long-term\nspatio-temporal forecasts, offering valuable insights for agriculture,\nirrigation planning, and water conservation strategies."}

On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our\nmodel achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal\narchitectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.\nAblation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only\nreaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic\nhyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\\tau}\n=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy\ncompared to other {\\tau} values ({\\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\\tau} =0.9:\n61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with\ncontrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce\nheritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-\nservation decision support systems."}

To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a\nthree-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in\nhuman-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which\ndistinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself\n(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to\nseparate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)\nConflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested\nthrough disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each\ndimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies\nmisalignment.

However, most time series foundation\nmodels are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the\nsame type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and\nPhotoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time\nseries foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,\ntraffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive\nbenchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist\nmodels, with a focus on PPG signals.

The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an\nempirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and\na selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action\nestimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior\nstate within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term\nduring temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility\nawareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a\nselective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly\nlower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined\nthreshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather\nthan progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids\ncatastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted\nrollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the\nCliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8\npercent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return.

We develop two\ninstantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and\ngPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage\nhigh-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless\nof expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented\ncounterpart in finite samples when experts are \"better than random.\"\nEmpirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with\ngPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains."}

In the considered\nsystem, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor\nnodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are\nevent-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the\nmonitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse\nradio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The\nreader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored\nenvironment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the\nfalse discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The\nproposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to\nmaintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it\ndynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm\nidentification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance\nevaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies\nunder stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor\ncommunications and achieving low detection latency."}
