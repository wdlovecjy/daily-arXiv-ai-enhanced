Conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage, yet split conformal uses a single global residual quantile and can be poorly adaptive under heteroscedasticity. Methods that improve adaptivity typically fit auxiliary nuisance models or introduce additional data splits/partitions to learn the conformal score, increasing cost and reducing data efficiency. We propose LoBoost, a model-native local conformal method that reuses the fitted ensemble's leaf structure to define multiscale calibration groups. Each input is encoded by its sequence of visited leaves; at resolution level k, we group points by matching prefixes of leaf indices across the first k trees and calibrate residual quantiles within each group. LoBoost requires no retraining, auxiliary models, or extra splitting beyond the standard train/calibration split. Experiments show competitive interval quality, improved test MSE on most datasets, and large calibration speedups."}

Coherent forecasts of these constrained series are anticipated to conform to their hierarchical structure organized by the aggregation rules. To enhance its resilience against potential irregular series, we explore the robust reconciliation process for hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting. We incorporate M-estimation to obtain the reconciled forecasts by minimizing a robust loss function of transforming a group of base forecasts subject to the aggregation constraints. The related minimization procedure is developed and implemented through a modified Newton-Raphson algorithm via local quadratic approximation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results suggest its feasibility in handling numerous abnormal cases (for instance, series with non-normal errors). The proposed robust reconciliation also demonstrates excellent efficiency when no outliers exist in HTS.

A family of imaging methods called Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which has been developed in the field of seismic imaging, uses full acoustic wave simulations as direct models, taking into account virtually all nonlinearities, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging. However, the problem of cycle skipping -- the existence of many local minima of the Least Squares (L2) misfit function due to the oscillatory nature of the signals -- is worsened when FWI is applied to ultrasound data because of a lack of low-frequency components. In this paper, we explore the use of the squared Wasserstein (W2) Optimal Transport Distance as the metric for the misfit between the acquired and the synthetic data, applying the method to Nondestructive Evaluation with ultrasonic phased arrays. An analytical continuous time-domain derivation of the adjoint acoustic field related to the W2 misfit is presented and used for the computation of the gradients. To cope with the computational burden of FWI, we apply a low-memory strategy that allows for the computation of the gradients without the storage of the full simulated fields. The GPU implementation of the method (in CUDA language) is detailed, and the source code is made available. Six prototypical cases are presented, and the corresponding sound speed maps are reconstructed with FWI using both the L2 and the W2 misfit functionals. In five of the six cases, the pixel-wise sum of squared errors obtained with W2 was at least one order of magnitude lower than that obtained with W2, with an increase in the gradient computation time not exceeding 2\\%. The results highlight both the adequacy of the W2 misfit for ultrasonic FWI with phased arrays and its computational feasibility."}

This setup encompasses direct and indirect standardization parameters familiar from healthcare provider profiling, and we additionally propose a \"performance above random replacement\" estimand designed for interpretability in sports settings. We develop doubly robust estimators for these evaluation metrics based on modern semiparametric statistical methods, with a focus on Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation, and incorporate machine learning methods to capture complex relationships driving player performance. We illustrate our framework in detailed case studies of field goal kickers in the National Football League and batters in Major League Baseball, highlighting how different causal estimands yield distinct interpretations and insights about player performance."}

The micro-signals that serve as RF fingerprints are termed ``micro-CSI''. Through experimentation, we have found that the presence of micro-CSI can primarily be attributed to imperfections in the RF circuitry. Furthermore, this characteristic signal is detectable in WiFi 4/5/6 network interface cards (NICs). We have conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI collection configurations to stabilize micro-CSI. Yet, extracting micro-CSI for authentication purposes poses a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the fact that CSI measurements inherently include both micro-CSI and the distortions introduced by wireless channels. These two elements are intricately intertwined, making their separation non-trivial. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a signal space-based extraction technique for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, which can effectively separate the distortions caused by wireless channels and micro-CSI. Over the course of our comprehensive CSI data collection period extending beyond one year, we found that the extracted micro-CSI displays unique characteristics specific to each WiFi device and remains invariant over time. This establishes micro-CSI as a suitable candidate for device fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a case study focusing on area access control for mobile robots. Our experimental results demonstrate that the micro-CSI-based authentication algorithm can achieve an average attack detection rate close to 99% with a false alarm rate of 0% in both static and mobile conditions when using 20 CSI measurements to construct one fingerprint."}

Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements."}

AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action."}

I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching."}

Submitted to IEEE Special Issue on \"Digital Twins for Wireless Networks: Enabling Application-Aware and Closed-Loop Optimization\"", "summary": "Beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems should take interference mitigation into account. However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints. For example, amplify-and-forward (AF) relays passively forward signals without measurement, precluding full CSI acquisition to and from the relay. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions. The estimated information is then used to update the digital twin with knowledge of the surrounding environment, enabling online optimization. Numerical results show the trade-off between localization accuracy and beamforming performance and confirm that PAO maintains robustness even in the presence of localization errors while reducing the need for real-world measurements."}

Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest."}

However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation."}

A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality."}

However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems."}

In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision.

Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone."}

However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods."}

Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality.

Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies.

We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.\n  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice."}

Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning."}

To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state).

Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research."}

Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance.

This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure."}

While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques."}

In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide.

We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance.

However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable \"safety valve\". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \\textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune \"stability\" and \"sensitivity\" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning."}

Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times.

In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.\n  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline."}

The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available."}

We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions."}

The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms."}

We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality."}

To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation.

Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound.

On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\\% for male players and 44\\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought."}

Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine."}

However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings."}

Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the \"more tuning, worse performance\" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives."}

However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments."}

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups."}

In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work."}

This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.\n  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.\n  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument."}

To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization."}

We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a \"translator\" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators."}

This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs."}

While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization."}

While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings."}

To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand.

Utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has recently been proposed to enable semantic communication of images. Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement. As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks."}

Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research."}

Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50.

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior."}

We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation."}

Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms."}

Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management."}

The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations."}

We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality."}

To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification.

Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation."}

While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment.

Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.\n  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups."}

To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties."}

We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior."}

It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference.

For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.\n  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation."}

We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark."}

We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task.
