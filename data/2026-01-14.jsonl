This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accuracy (ROC-AUC: 0.9703). A validation study with 14 healthcare professionals in Bangladesh revealed strong preference for hybrid explanations (71.4% across three clinical cases) with 54.8% expressing trust for clinical use. SHAP analysis identified healthcare access as the primary predictor, with the engineered fuzzy risk score ranking third, validating clinical knowledge integration (r=0.298). Clinicians valued integrated clinical parameters but identified critical gaps: obstetric history, gestational age, and connectivity barriers. This work demonstrates that combining interpretable fuzzy rules with feature importance explanations enhances both utility and trust, providing practical insights for XAI deployment in maternal healthcare."}

To this end, we propose a new combinatorial structure in directed acyclic graphs called the directed convex hull, which has turned out to be equivalent to their minimum localized Bayesian networks. An efficient polynomial-time algorithm is devised to identify them by determining the unique directed convex hulls containing the variables of interest from the original networks. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has high dimension reduction capability in real networks, and the efficiency of probabilistic inference based on directed convex hulls can be significantly improved compared with traditional methods such as variable elimination and belief propagation algorithms.

A recursive rank-reducing strategy and a reverse Cuthill-Mckee (RCM) permutation are introduced to align high weights towards the diagonal with the block-diagonal hierarchy, maximising off-diagonal compressibility (because they are touched only once).

We examined whether passively captured, fine-grained emotions serve as linguistic markers of treatment outcomes by analyzing 12 weeks of de-identified teletherapy transcripts from 12,043 U.S. patients with moderate-to-severe anxiety and depression symptoms. A transformer-based small language model extracted patients' emotions at the talk-turn level; a state-space model (VISTA) clustered subgroups based on emotion dynamics over time and produced temporal networks. Two groups emerged: an improving group (n=8,230) and a non-response group (n=3813) showing increased odds of symptom deterioration, and lower likelihood of clinically significant improvement. Temporal networks indicated that sadness and fear exerted most influence on emotion dynamics in non-responders, whereas improving patients showed balanced joy, sadness, and neutral expressions. Findings suggest that linguistic markers of emotional inflexibility can serve as scalable, interpretable, and theoretically grounded indicators for treatment risk stratification."}

Propeller-driven Vibration Testing (PVT) is assessed here as an output-only alternative, in line with Operational Modal Analysis approaches such as Taxi Vibration Testing and Flight Vibration Testing. A cantilever Aluminium 7075-T6 wing spar is instrumented with seven accelerometers and excited by an outboard electric motor and propeller. Seven runs are carried out: a motor-off baseline, five constant-throttle cases, and a manual up-down throttle sweep. The acquired spectra indicate that the dominant resonances remain observable under propeller excitation, while low-throttle conditions introduce narrowband harmonics that may mask structural peaks; the sweep reduces persistent overlap. Modal parameters are identified for the baseline and sweep cases using the Natural Excitation Technique with the Loewner Framework (NExT-LF). The first two modes remain closely matched (Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) > 0.99), whereas the third mode shows reduced repeatability (MAC = 0.827) and a larger frequency shift, consistent with propeller-induced bending--torsion coupling and non-ideal sweep control.

Although fitting separate logistic regressions for each response is computationally attractive, it ignores shared structure and can be statistically inefficient, especially in high-dimensional and class-imbalanced regimes. Low-rank models offer a natural way to encode latent dependence across tasks, but existing methods for binary data are largely likelihood-based and focus on pointwise classification rather than ranking performance. In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure. We develop a scalable projected gradient descent algorithm based on truncated singular value decomposition. Exploiting the fact that the pairwise loss depends only on differences of linear predictors, we simplify computation and analysis. We establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees, showing that under suitable regularity conditions, leading to linear convergence up to the minimax-optimal statistical precision. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in challenging settings such as label switching and data contamination and consistently outperforms likelihood-based approaches."}

However, the theoretical properties of such models in relation with fairness are still poorly understood, and the intuition behind the relationship between group and individual fairness is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework based on Sheaf Diffusion to leverage tools based on dynamical systems and homology to model fairness. Concretely, the proposed method projects input data into a bias-free space that encodes fairness constrains, resulting in fair solutions. Furthermore, we present a collection of network topologies handling different fairness metrics, leading to a unified method capable of dealing with both individual and group bias. The resulting models have a layer of interpretability in the form of closed-form expressions for their SHAP values, consolidating their place in the responsible Artificial Intelligence landscape. Finally, these intuitions are tested on a simulation study and standard fairness benchmarks, where the proposed methods achieve satisfactory results. More concretely, the paper showcases the performance of the proposed models in terms of accuracy and fairness, studying available trade-offs on the Pareto frontier, checking the effects of changing the different hyper-parameters, and delving into the interpretation of its outputs."}

Although the reliability of SAPF in space environments has been thoroughly studied, its reliability in ground environments during storage is always ignored, potentially leading to system failure. This paper aims to investigate the reliability of SAPF in storage environments, focusing on the effects of temperature and relative humidity. Firstly, the relationship between the performance degradation of SAPF and aluminum corrosion is identified. Next, considering the presence of two distinct stages in the influence of temperature on aluminum corrosion, a novel degradation model accounting for the degradation mechanism transition is developed. Additionally, a parameter analysis method is proposed for determining SAPF degradation mechanism based on experimental data. Then, a statistical analysis method incorporating an improved rime optimization algorithm is employed for parameter estimation, and the reliability model is established. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies two distinct stages in the impact of temperature on SAPF performance degradation. Furthermore, the proposed degradation model outperforms traditional degradation models with unchanged degradation mechanism in terms of degradation prediction accuracy, extrapolation capability and robustness, indicating its suitability for describing the degradation pattern of SAPFs."}

Meta-backscatter systems that utilize metamaterial tags present a promising solution, retaining the inherent advantages of BF-IoT while breaking the critical communication range barrier. By leveraging densely paved sub-wavelength units to concentrate the reflected signal power, metamaterial tags enable a significant communication range extension over existing BF-IoT tags that employ omni-directional antennas. In this paper, we synthesize the principles and paradigms of metamaterial sensing to establish a unified design framework and a forward-looking research roadmap.

This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices."}

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization."}

While most existing studies assume constant flow conditions, real macro scale environments such as atmospheric winds exhibit time varying behavior. In this work, airborne particle communication under time varying advection is modeled as a linear time varying (LTV) channel, and a closed form, time dependent channel impulse response is derived using the method of moving frames. Based on this formulation, the channel is characterized through its power delay profile, leading to the definition of channel dispersion time as a physically meaningful measure of channel memory and a guideline for symbol duration selection. System level simulations under directed, time varying wind conditions show that waveform design is critical for performance, enabling multi symbol modulation using a single particle type when dispersion is sufficiently controlled. The results demonstrate that time varying diffusion advection channels can be systematically modeled and engineered using communication theoretic tools, providing a realistic foundation for particle based communication in complex flow environments."}

We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites."}

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size.

We also introduce an AI Companion benchmark designed to holistically evaluate the AI Companion across both its conversational quality and memory capabilities. In our experiments, we found that our system (using a very weak model: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct quantized int4) outperforms the equivalent raw LLM without memory across most metrics, and performs comparably to GPT-3.5 with 16k context window."}

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Therefore, the rules designed for offline players need to be modified to ensure the fairness of online single-round play. Specifically, We employ a world champion AI to engage in self-play competitions and conduct statistical data analysis. Our study reveals the first-mover advantage and issues in the subgoal scoring settings. Based on our findings, we propose rule adaptations to make the game more suitable for the online environment, such as introducing compensatory points for the first-mover advantage and refining the scores of subgoals for different tile patterns. Compared with the traditional method of rotating positions over multiple rounds to balance first-mover advantage, our compensatory points mechanism in each round is more convenient for online players. Furthermore, we implement the revised Mahjong game online, which is open for online players.

In this study, we evaluate a range of reinforcement learning-based neighborhood selection strategies -- multi-armed bandits (upper confidence bound, $ε$-greedy) and deep reinforcement learning methods (proximal policy optimization, double deep $Q$-network) -- and compare them against multiple baselines across three different problems: the traveling salesman problem, the pickup and delivery problem with time windows, and the car sequencing problem. We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $ε$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime. These findings highlight both the promise and the practical limitations of deep reinforcement learning in local search."}

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy."}

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems. We conclude by outlining a research direction in which coordination arises from shared semantic representations rather than explicitly engineered numerical signals."}

To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE. Case studies for the major destination port further illustrate the model's superior accuracy."}

Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings."}

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness."}

Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.\n  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability.

We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively.

To enable end-to-end gradient flow, we employ an actor-critic architecture consisting of an {action-net} to navigate the input space and a {variational critic} to estimate information gain. This formulation effectively eliminates the traditional inner-loop acquisition optimization bottleneck, achieving up to a {$10^2 \\times$ reduction in FLOPs} compared to BNN-BO baselines. We evaluate our method on a diverse suite of benchmarks, including high-dimensional synthetic functions and complex real-world tasks such as PDE optimization, the Lunar Lander control problem, and categorical Pest Control. Our experiments demonstrate that VBO-MI consistently provides the same or superior optimization performance and computational scalability over the baselines."}

This lack of interpretability makes it important to study how these models process and transform input features. In this work, we analyze the information encoded inside the model's hidden representations and examine how these representations evolve across layers. We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models. They show that these models encode concrete and interpretable information, which moves us closer to making their decision processes more transparent and trustworthy."}

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure."}

It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG).

For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes.

Inspired by this, we introduce What If TSF (WIT), a multimodal forecasting benchmark designed to evaluate whether models can condition their forecasts on contextual text, especially future scenarios.

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features.

Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework. Experiments on 21 multi-label datasets using several representative methods demonstrate that performance rankings differ markedly from those reported under single-label settings, suggesting the possibility of multi-label evaluation settings for fair and reliable comparison of unsupervised feature selection methods."}

However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance."}

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems."}

To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods.

Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

We show how search-specific characteristics, particularly large variations in cost due to constraint violation penalties, necessitate carefully designed reward functions to provide stable and informative learning signals. Our extensive experiments reveal that algorithm performance varies substantially across problems, although that $ε$-greedy consistently ranks among the best performers. In contrast, the computational overhead of deep reinforcement learning approaches only makes them competitive with a substantially longer runtime.

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy."}

The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage.

In this work, we propose a unified framework for learning with multiple binary responses that directly targets discrimination by minimizing a surrogate loss for the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The method aggregates pairwise AUC surrogate losses across responses while imposing a low-rank constraint on the coefficient matrix to exploit shared structure.

This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures.

Maximal Update Parametrization ($\\boldsymbolμ$P) provides a theoretical safeguard for width-invariant $Θ(1)$ activation control, whereas emerging optimizers like Muon are only ``half-aligned'' with these constraints: they control updates but allow weights to drift. To address this limitation, we introduce the \\textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\\boldsymbolμ$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon. Furthermore, we observe significant practical stability benefits, including improved MoE router load balancing, suppressed outliers, and strictly bounded activations."}

Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness."}

While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels."}

We study reconstruction-based anomaly detection for ensemble data from parameterized Kármán vortex street simulations using convolutional autoencoders. We compare a 2D autoencoder operating on individual frames with a 3D autoencoder that processes short temporal stacks. The 2D model identifies localized spatial irregularities in single time steps, while the 3D model exploits spatio-temporal context to detect anomalous motion patterns and reduces redundant detections across time. We further evaluate volumetric time-dependent data and find that reconstruction errors are strongly influenced by the spatial distribution of mass, with highly concentrated regions yielding larger errors than dispersed configurations. Our results highlight the importance of temporal context for robust anomaly detection in dynamic simulations."}
