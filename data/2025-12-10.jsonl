This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks."}

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems."}

Therefore, we aimed to determine how phytoplankton distributions define marine provinces across 3-dimensions (i.e., latitude, longitude, and depth). To do this, we developed a new algorithm called \\texttt{bioprovince} which can be applied to compositional biological data. The algorithm first clusters compositional samples to identify spatially coherent groups of samples, then makes flexible province predictions in the broader 3d spatial grid based on environmental similarity. We applied \\texttt{bioprovince} to phytoplankton Amplicon Sequencing Variants (ASVs) from five, depth-resolved ocean transects spanning north-south in the Pacific Ocean. In the surface layer of the ocean, our method agreed well with traditional Longhurst provinces. In some cases, the method revealed that with more granular taxonomic resolution afforded by ASVs, traditional Longhurst provinces were divided into smaller zones. Also, one of the major advances of this method is its ability to incorporate a third dimension, depth. Indeed, our analysis found significant depth-wise partitions throughout the Pacific with remarkable agreement in the equatorial region with the base of the euphotic zone. Our algorithm's ability to delineate 3-dimensional bioprovinces will enable scientists to discover new ecological interpretations of marine phytoplankton ecology and biogeography. Furthermore, as compositional biological data inherently exists in three spatial dimensions in nature, bioprovince is broadly applicable beyond marine plankton, offering a more holistic perspective on biological provinces across diverse environments."}

The growing availability of large-scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) datasets has opened new opportunities for applying machine learning to aerodynamic and engineering design. Yet, despite this progress, there exists no standardized benchmark for large-scale numerical simulations in engineering design. In this work, we introduce CarBench, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to large-scale 3D car aerodynamics, performing a large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art models on DrivAerNet++, the largest public dataset for automotive aerodynamics, containing over 8,000 high-fidelity car simulations.

Beyond standard interpolation tasks, we perform cross-category experiments in which transformer-based solvers trained on a single car archetype are evaluated on unseen categories. Our analysis covers predictive accuracy, physical consistency, computational efficiency, and statistical uncertainty.

Expected publication in 2026", "summary": "Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called \"empowerment\" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. \"Empowerment\" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions."}

Linking these data to key events such as shots, passes, and rebounds opens a new era in NBA analytics. Here, we leverage Hawk-Eye tracking to introduce a novel ensemble of metrics for evaluating free-throw shooting and demonstrate that our framework captures skill more effectively than traditional make-or-miss statistics. Inspired by baseball analytics, we introduce command, which quantifies the quality of a free throw by measuring a shooter's accuracy and precision near the basket's bullseye. This metric recognizes that some makes (or misses) are better than others and captures a player's ability to execute quality attempts consistently. To identify what drives command, we define launch-based metrics assessing consistency in release velocity, angle, and 3D position. Players with greater touch -- i.e., more consistent launch dynamics -- exhibit stronger command as they can reliably control their shot trajectory. Finally, we develop a physics model to identify the range of launch conditions that result in a make and to determine which launch conditions are most robust to small perturbations. This framework reveals \"safe\" launch regions and explains why certain players, such as Steph Curry, excel at free throws, providing actionable insights for player development."}

When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context."}

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $τ$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%.

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure."}

Despite this widespread adoption, the principles that determine their performance remain underexplored, leaving practitioners to rely on heuristics rather than principled design choices. We address this gap by deriving quantitative scaling principles for agent systems. We evaluate this across four diverse benchmarks: Finance-Agent, BrowseComp-Plus, PlanCraft, and Workbench. Using five canonical architectures (Single, Independent, Centralized, Decentralized, Hybrid) instantiated across three LLM families, we perform a controlled evaluation spanning 180 configurations with standardized tools and token budgets. We derive a predictive model using empirical coordination metrics, including efficiency, overhead, error amplification, and redundancy, that achieves cross-validated R^2=0.513. We identify three dominant effects: (1) a tool-coordination trade-off: under fixed computational budgets, tool-heavy tasks suffer disproportionately from multi-agent overhead. (2) a capability saturation: coordination yields diminishing or negative returns (beta=-0.408, p<0.001) once single-agent baselines exceed ~45%. (3) topology-dependent error amplification: independent agents amplify errors 17.2x through unchecked propagation, while centralized coordination contains this to 4.4x. Centralized coordination improves performance by 80.9% on parallelizable tasks like financial reasoning, while decentralized coordination excels on dynamic web navigation (+9.2% vs. +0.2%).

To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications.

If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories."}

Existing studies typically treat these components separately or rely on environment-specific multipath models. In this work, we develop a unified LoS+NLoS channel representation for holographic lines that integrates spatial-sampling-based and expansion-based formulations. Building on this model, we extend the wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) framework, originally introduced for purely LoS channels, to the LoS+NLoS scenario. Applying WDM to the NLoS component yields its angular-domain representation, enabling direct characterization through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further derive closed-form characterizations for isotropic and non-isotropic scattering, with the former recovering Jakes' isotropic model. Lastly, we evaluate the resulting degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity, showing that incorporating the NLoS component substantially improves the performance relative to the purely LoS case."}

TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FAIM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and exhibits outstanding performance."}

Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches.

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

As AI systems increasingly influence high-stakes domains including healthcare, finance, and public policy, the alignment problem--ensuring AI behavior corresponds with human values and intentions--has become critical. Current approaches predominantly optimize technical performance metrics while neglecting the sociotechnical dimensions of AI deployment. IDAIF addresses this gap by establishing a systematic mapping between ToC's five-stage model (Inputs-Activities-Outputs-Outcomes-Impact) and corresponding AI architectural layers (Data Layer-Pipeline Layer-Inference Layer-Agentic Layer-Normative Layer). Each layer incorporates rigorous theoretical foundations: multi-objective Pareto optimization for value alignment, hierarchical multi-agent orchestration for outcome achievement, causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for hallucination mitigation, and adversarial debiasing with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fairness assurance. We provide formal mathematical formulations for each component and introduce an Assurance Layer that manages assumption failures through guardian architectures. Three case studies demonstrate IDAIF application across healthcare, cybersecurity, and software engineering domains.

While the narrowband version of this transformation can be performed efficiently with a spatial fast Fourier transform, the broadband setting requires coherent processing of multiple array snapshots simultaneously. Our algorithm works by taking $N$ samples off of each of $M$ sensors and encoding the sensor outputs into a set of coefficients using a special non-uniform spaced Fourier transform. From these coefficients, each beam is formed by solving a small system of equations that has Toeplitz structure. The total runtime complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(M\\log N+B\\log N)$ operations per sample, exhibiting essentially the same scaling as in the narrowband case and vastly outperforming broadband beamformers based on delay and sum whose computations scale as $\\mathcal{O}(MB)$. Alongside a careful mathematical formulation and analysis of our fast broadband beamspace transform, we provide a host of numerical experiments demonstrating the algorithm's favorable computational scaling and high accuracy.

We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure."}

To confront their variable working conditions, transfer learning (TL) emerges as a promising technique for leveraging knowledge from data-rich source working conditions, significantly reducing the training data required for SOH monitoring from target working conditions. However, traditional TL-based SOH monitoring is infeasible when applied in portable mobile devices since substantial computational resources are consumed during the TL stage and unexpectedly reduce the working endurance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight TL-based SOH monitoring approach with constructive incremental transfer learning (CITL). First, taking advantage of the unlabeled data in the target domain, a semi-supervised TL mechanism is proposed to minimize the monitoring residual in a constructive way, through iteratively adding network nodes in the CITL. Second, the cross-domain learning ability of node parameters for CITL is comprehensively guaranteed through structural risk minimization, transfer mismatching minimization, and manifold consistency maximization. Moreover, the convergence analysis of the CITL is given, theoretically guaranteeing the efficacy of TL performance and network compactness. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through extensive experiments with a realistic unmanned air vehicles (UAV) battery dataset collected from dozens of flight missions. Specifically, the CITL outperforms SS-TCA, MMD-LSTM-DA, DDAN, BO-CNN-TL, and AS$^3$LSTM, in SOH estimation by 83.73%, 61.15%, 28.24%, 87.70%, and 57.34%, respectively, as evaluated using the index root mean square error."}

MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs."}

To better understand this fragility, we ask a simple question: \\emph{do all actions contribute equally to failure?} Analyzing execution traces on $τ$-Bench (Airline/Retail) and SWE-Bench Verified, we decompose trajectories into \\emph{mutating} (environment-changing) vs.\\ non-mutating steps and formalize \\emph{decisive deviations}, earliest action, level divergences that flip success to failure. A logistic regression reveals that each additional deviation in a mutating action reduces the odds of success by upto $92\\%$ on Airline and upto $96\\%$ on Retail for SoTA models. In contrast, deviations in non-mutating actions have little to no effect. Errors also grow with context length as agents drift from role and act on stale constraints. Motivated by these observations, we introduce \\cm{}, a model-agnostic, gradient-free, test-time safeguard that (i) adds mutation-gated verification, (ii) injects \\emph{Targeted Reflection} before mutating steps, and (iii) performs block-based context cleaning. \\cm{} delivers consistent gains, e.g., Qwen3-Thinking: +28\\% \\emph{relative} on Airline, +11\\% on Retail, and +7\\% on SWE-Bench Verified; Claude: +9\\%/+7\\%. We further identify ceiling effects in $τ$-Bench, where annotation errors and underspecified tasks artificially cap model performance. To address this, we release $τ$-Bench Verified, which restores benchmark headroom through targeted revisions. Our results argue for action-level analysis, targeted safeguards, and reliable evaluations as prerequisites for robust multi-turn agents."}

In many scientific and engineering settings the response is functional, varying smoothly over an index such as time or wavelength, which makes classical formulations inadequate. Existing methods often minimize integrated error, which captures average performance but neglects worst case deviations. To address this limitation we propose min-max Functional Bayesian Optimization (MM-FBO), a framework that directly minimizes the maximum error across the functional domain. Functional responses are represented using functional principal component analysis, and Gaussian process surrogates are constructed for the principal component scores. Building on this representation, MM-FBO introduces an integrated uncertainty acquisition function that balances exploitation of worst case expected error with exploration across the functional domain. We provide two theoretical guarantees: a discretization bound for the worst case objective, and a consistency result showing that as the surrogate becomes accurate and uncertainty vanishes, the acquisition converges to the true min-max objective. We validate the method through experiments on synthetic benchmarks and physics inspired case studies involving electromagnetic scattering by metaphotonic devices and vapor phase infiltration. Results show that MM-FBO consistently outperforms existing baselines and highlights the importance of explicitly modeling functional uncertainty in Bayesian optimization."}

However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks."}

Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping. Additionally, curve specific similarity metrics replace traditional Euclidean measures to preserve functional characteristics during leaf assignment. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including biomedical signals and sensor trajectories demonstrate that FRF-ACS significantly improves minority class recall and overall predictive performance compared to existing functional classifiers and imbalance handling techniques. This work provides a scalable, interpretable solution for high dimensional functional data analysis in domains where minority class detection is critical."}

If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories."}

We study certified unlearning in decentralized networks with fixed topologies and propose RR-DU, a random-walk procedure that performs one projected gradient ascent step on the forget set at the unlearning client and a geometrically distributed number of projected descent steps on the retained data elsewhere, combined with subsampled Gaussian noise and projection onto a trust region around the original model. We provide (i) convergence guarantees in the convex case and stationarity guarantees in the nonconvex case, (ii) $(\\varepsilon,δ)$ network-unlearning certificates on client views via subsampled Gaussian $Rényi$ DP (RDP) with segment-level subsampling, and (iii) deletion-capacity bounds that scale with the forget-to-local data ratio and quantify the effect of decentralization (network mixing and randomized subsampling) on the privacy--utility trade-off.

Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately.

In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses."}

Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain."}

In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches."}

This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone."}

For linear approximation, TD($λ$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value.

We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($λ$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1]. This is followed by successful demonstrations of STD($λ$) on the two-state system and a variation on the well known acrobot problem."}

Traditional Random Forest algorithms, while robust for tabular data, often fail to capture the intrinsic structure of functional observations and struggle with minority class detection. This paper introduces Functional Random Forest with Adaptive Cost-Sensitive Splitting (FRF-ACS), a novel ensemble framework designed for imbalanced functional data classification. The proposed method leverages basis expansions and Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to represent curves efficiently, enabling trees to operate on low dimensional functional features. To address imbalance, we incorporate a dynamic cost sensitive splitting criterion that adjusts class weights locally at each node, combined with a hybrid sampling strategy integrating functional SMOTE and weighted bootstrapping. Additionally, curve specific similarity metrics replace traditional Euclidean measures to preserve functional characteristics during leaf assignment. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world datasets including biomedical signals and sensor trajectories demonstrate that FRF-ACS significantly improves minority class recall and overall predictive performance compared to existing functional classifiers and imbalance handling techniques. This work provides a scalable, interpretable solution for high dimensional functional data analysis in domains where minority class detection is critical."}

It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed.

When successful, such an approach eliminates the need for experts to design heuristics per problem type. Due to their structure, many hard CO problems are amenable to treatment through reinforcement learning (RL). Indeed, we find a wealth of literature training NNs using value-based, policy gradient, or actor-critic approaches, with promising results, both in terms of empirical optimality gaps and inference runtimes. Nevertheless, there has been a paucity of theoretical work undergirding the use of RL for CO problems. To this end, we introduce a unified framework to model CO problems through Markov decision processes (MDPs) and solve them using RL techniques. We provide easy-to-test assumptions under which CO problems can be formulated as equivalent undiscounted MDPs that provide optimal solutions to the original CO problems. Moreover, we establish conditions under which value-based RL techniques converge to approximate solutions of the CO problem with a guarantee on the associated optimality gap. Our convergence analysis provides: (1) a sufficient rate of increase in batch size and projected gradient descent steps at each RL iteration; (2) the resulting optimality gap in terms of problem parameters and targeted RL accuracy; and (3) the importance of a choice of state-space embedding. Together, our analysis illuminates the success (and limitations) of the celebrated deep Q-learning algorithm in this problem context."}
