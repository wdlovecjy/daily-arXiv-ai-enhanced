This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and\ndynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data\nscheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.\nHowever, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based\nmetrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these\nqueries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score\n(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the\nstructure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning\nTree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a\ncurriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low\nr-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that\nRe-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to\n3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a\nstructural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and\nprincipled foundation for RLVR data scheduling."}

Recent advancements in deep\nlearning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques.\nHowever, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that\nnecessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered\ncomputing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless\nnetworks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for\ndistributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to\nperform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this\ninvestigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this\ndistributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying\nmodulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective\nof the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncentralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate\nof 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around\n41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods\nexhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers,\nthe initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while\nsubstantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized\nmodel. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature\nmap, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies\na substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach.\nThese findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly\nenhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of\nbandwidth-limited wireless networks."}

Although over-approximation\nmethods have shown success in neural network verification to address this\nchallenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.\nFurthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight\nlocal Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.\nOriginally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was\nproposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and\ncomplete verification.

In this study,\nwe propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection\nand prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may\nindicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT\nScalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures\ncollected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant\nepilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised\nmachine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic\nRegression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression\nachieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced\nperformance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector\nMachine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to\ndetect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for\nevaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we\nemployed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to\nmodel temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%\nprediction accuracy.

In this paper, we present an implementation of several such\ndifferentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular\nPyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible\nto a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison\nbetween them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several\nexisting studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several\ncommon challenges with state space modelling."}
