Performance was\nbenchmarked against six state-of-the-art autoencoders using reconstruction\nmetrics, rhythm classification, and robustness across signal-to-noise ratios\nfrom -5 to 15 dB. In downstream rhythm classification, CLARAE achieved\nF1-scores above 0.97 for all rhythm types, and its latent space showed clear\nclustering by rhythm. In denoising tasks, it consistently ranked among the top\nperformers for both unipolar and bipolar signals.\n  In order to promote reproducibility and enhance accessibility, we offer an\ninteractive web-based application. This platform enables users to explore\npre-trained CLARAE models, visualize the reconstructions, and compute metrics\nin real time. Overall, CLARAE combines robust denoising with compact,\ndiscriminative representations, offering a practical foundation for clinical\nworkflows such as rhythm discrimination, signal quality assessment, and\nreal-time mapping."}

The two phases are: the identification of the district metering area\n(DMA) and the pipe pre-localization into the identified DMA. The strategy is\nbased on detecting and pre-localizing the punctual leakage as anomaly with\nrespect to the normal working conditions. A further novelty is the fact that\nthe pre-localization phase returns the sequence of pipes to inspect, which\nmakes the strategy attractive for water utilities, whose aim is to identify the\nanomaly at DMA level and, successively, to localize it with the minimum\ninspection cost. Furthermore, a random database is useful to test the\nperformance of the strategy with respect to the configuration of DMAs and the\npressure metering system. Consequently, a novel strategy to design the location\nof pressure meters is also proposed.

Existing RLVR methods,\nhowever, typically treat all tokens uniformly without accounting for\ntoken-level advantages. These methods primarily evaluate performance based on\nfinal answer correctness or Pass@K accuracy, and yet make claims about RL\npost-training leading to improved reasoning traces. This motivates our\ninvestigation into the effect of RL post-training on intermediate tokens which\nare not directly incentivized. To study this, we design an experimental setup\nusing the GRPO algorithm with Qwen-2.5-0.5B model on the GSM8K dataset. We\nintroduce trace coherence, a First-Order Logic (FOL)-based measure to capture\nthe consistency of reasoning steps by identifying errors in the traces. We\ndistinguish between trace validity and trace coherence, noting that the former\nimplies logical soundness while the latter measures local coherence via lack of\nerrors. Our results show that RL post-training overall improves trace coherence\nwith the most significant gains on problems where the base model fails but the\nRL model succeeds. Surprisingly, RL enhances local coherence without\nnecessarily producing valid or correct solutions. This highlights a crucial\ndistinction: improved local coherence in reasoning steps does not guarantee\nfinal answer correctness.

Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn\nat biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.\nThrough analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal\noverlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding\nerror signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength\ndeclines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus\nduration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.\nCritically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to\nexceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical\ncortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity\nwindow in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies\nseconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in\nbiological circuits."}

Our\nnovel analytical framework establishes precise algorithm-dependent and\ndata-dependent excess risk bounds that characterize how different quantization\naffects learning: parameter, activation, and gradient quantization amplify\nnoise during training; data quantization distorts the data spectrum; and data\nand label quantization introduce additional approximation and quantized error.\nCrucially, we prove that for multiplicative quantization (with input-dependent\nquantization step), this spectral distortion can be eliminated, and for\nadditive quantization (with constant quantization step), a beneficial scaling\neffect with batch size emerges. Furthermore, for common polynomial-decay data\nspectra, we quantitatively compare the risks of multiplicative and additive\nquantization, drawing a parallel to the comparison between FP and integer\nquantization methods. Our theory provides a powerful lens to characterize how\nquantization shapes the learning dynamics of optimization algorithms, paving\nthe way to further explore learning theory under practical hardware\nconstraints."}

Recent studies have employed vector quantization\n(VQ) to enable discrete semantic transmission, yet existing methods neglect\nchannel state information during codebook optimization, leading to suboptimal\nrobustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization\n(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed\nVQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,\nsemantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation\nconstellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities\ninto the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with\nsemantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further\nintroduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by\ndecomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized\nsubchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates\nthe digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across\nvarious modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic\ncommunication baselines in both robustness and efficiency."}

We conducted a comprehensive comparative evaluation of three\ntopic modelling approaches: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Structural Topic\nModelling (STM), and BERTopic. We also introduced a novel algorithm, named\nCOFFEE, designed to enable robust covariate effect estimation for BERTopic.\nThis advancement addresses a significant gap, as BERTopic lacks a native\nfunction for covariate analysis, unlike the probabilistic STM. Our findings\nhighlight that while all models effectively delineate core scientific domains,\nBERTopic outperformed by consistently identifying more granular, coherent, and\nemergent themes, such as the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.\nAdditionally, the covariate analysis, powered by COFFEE, confirmed distinct\nprovincial research specializations and revealed consistent gender-based\nthematic patterns across various scientific disciplines. These insights offer a\nrobust empirical foundation for funding organizations to formulate more\nequitable and impactful funding strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness\nof the scientific ecosystem."}
