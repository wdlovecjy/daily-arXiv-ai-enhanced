Existing caregiver burden instruments, while valuable in\nclinical research, often lack compatibility with observational datasets\nregularly used in health services research and planning. This study introduces\nthe Caregiver Burden Index (CareBI) developed for the National Study of\nCaregiving (NSOC), that can be used to represent caregiver burden in\nquantitative models and observational research studies. CareBI was developed\nand validated using a multistep process that included the identification and\npreparation of individual NSOC survey items, exploratory and confirmatory\nfactor analysis, score estimation, interpretation, and external validation. The\nstudy used data from round 12 of the NSOC. CareBI represents three domains of\nburden: objective, subjective, and interpersonal, providing a comprehensive\nview of both the positive and negative aspects of caregiving. It also aligns\nwith the Zarit Burden Interview, a widely used tool for prospectively assessing\ncaregiver burden. Construct validity was assessed by comparing CareBI's\nrelationship with caregiver and care recipient outcomes, as well as sensitivity\nto known burden-related risk and mitigation factors. Early findings affirm the\nscale's utility in categorizing low-, moderate-, and high-burden caregivers and\nguiding resource-oriented strategies.

Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:\nencrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting\ngradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,\na practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal\noverhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping\nnon-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.\nIt introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which\ndecomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup\ntable, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary\nremains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and\nPrune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to\nminimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments\nshow that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\\times$ and accelerates\ntraining by 28-65$\\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming\nstate-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\\times$ in overhead and\n4-19$\\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\\times$ of\nplaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated\nlearning is practical for real-world deployment.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting\nfrom outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process.

Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary\ndetectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in\ncompute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over\nstrong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types\noften imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,\nsuggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments."}

However, these models operate as black\nboxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the\nheuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by\napplying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,\nto a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of\nactivation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We\ntrain a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then\nfit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete\ndictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver\nnaturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary\ndetectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features\nresponding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric\npartitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what\nneural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric\nstructure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward\ntransparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic\ninterpretability.

Muller", "Brani Vidakovic"], "title": "A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate\nmodeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within\nnon-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold\ndetectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often\nlarge amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort\ncomplex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study\nexplores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale\napplications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be\nanalyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying\ndynamics.\n  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two\nsingle-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it\nboth in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated\nand real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the\nproposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection\ncompared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is\nfurther improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while\noutperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based\ndetection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal\nidentification, with potential applications in various disciplines."}
