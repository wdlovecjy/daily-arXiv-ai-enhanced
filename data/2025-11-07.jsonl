We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code.

Yet the best models still suffer from\nhallucinations when reasoning about scenes in the real world, revealing a gap\nbetween their seemingly strong performance on existing perception benchmarks\nthat are saturating and their reasoning in the real world. To address this gap,\nwe build a novel benchmark of in-the-wild scenes that we call Common-O. With\nmore than 10.5k examples using exclusively new images not found in web training\ndata to avoid contamination, Common-O goes beyond just perception, inspired by\ncognitive tests for humans, to probe reasoning across scenes by asking \"what's\nin common?\". We evaluate leading multimodal language models, including models\nspecifically trained to perform chain-of-thought reasoning. We find that\nperceiving objects in single images is tractable for most models, yet reasoning\nacross scenes is very challenging even for the best models, including reasoning\nmodels. Despite saturating many leaderboards focusing on perception, the best\nperforming model only achieves 35% on Common-O -- and on Common-O Complex,\nconsisting of more complex scenes, the best model achieves only 1%. Curiously,\nwe find models are more prone to hallucinate when similar objects are present\nin the scene, suggesting models may be relying on object co-occurrence seen\nduring training.

Previous works consider either simple coverage maximization or\nsimultaneous optimization of the placement of the RIS along with the\nbeamforming and reflection coefficients, most of which assume that the location\nof the RIS, base station (BS), and users are known. However, in practice, only\nthe spatial variation of user density and obstacle configuration are likely to\nbe known prior to deployment of the system. Thus, we formulate a non-convex\nproblem that optimizes the position of the RIS over the expected minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the system with user\nrandomness, assuming that the system employs joint beamforming after\ndeployment. To solve this problem, we propose a recursive coarse-to-fine\nmethodology that constructs a set of candidate locations for RIS placement\nbased on the obstacle configuration and evaluates them over multiple\ninstantiations from the user distribution. The search is recursively refined\nwithin the optimal region identified in each stage to determine the final\noptimal region for RIS deployment.

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT), which\nleverages a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict student knowledge and\nperformance on exercises, has been proposed as a major advancement over\ntraditional KT methods. Several studies suggest that its performance gains stem\nfrom its ability to model bidirectional relationships between different\nknowledge components (KCs) within a course, enabling the inference of a\nstudent's understanding of one KC from their performance on others. In this\npaper, we challenge this prevailing explanation and demonstrate that DKT's\nstrength lies in its implicit ability to model prerequisite relationships as a\ncausal structure, rather than bidirectional relationships. By pruning exercise\nrelation graphs into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and training DKT on causal\nsubsets of the Assistments dataset, we show that DKT's predictive capabilities\nalign strongly with these causal structures. Furthermore, we propose an\nalternative method for extracting exercise relation DAGs using DKT's learned\nrepresentations and provide empirical evidence supporting our claim.

However, empirical\nfindings indicate that markers often exhibit varying performances across\npopulations. For prognostic markers whose results are used to quantify of the\nrisk of an outcome, oftentimes a form of updating is required when the marker\nis transported to populations with different disease prevalences. Here, we\nrevisit transportability of prognostic markers through the lens of the\nfoundational framework of sufficient component causes (SCC). We argue that\ntransporting a marker \"as is\" implicitly assumes predictive values are\ntransportable, whereas conventional prevalence-adjustment shifts the locus of\ntransportability to accuracy metrics (sensitivity and specificity). Using a\nminimalist SCC framework that decomposes risk prediction into its causal\nconstituents, we show that both approaches rely on strong assumptions about the\nstability of cause distributions across populations. A SCC framework instead\ninvites making transparent assumptions about how different causes vary across\npopulations, leading to different transportation methods. For example, in the\nabsence of any external information other than disease prevalence, a\ncause-neutral perspective can assume all causes are responsible for change in\nprevalence, leading to a new form of marker transportation. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that different transportability assumptions lead to\nvarying degrees of information loss, depending on how population differ from\neach other in the distribution of causes. A SCC perspective challenges common\nassumptions and practices for marker transportability, and proposes\ntransportation algorithms that reflect our knowledge or assumptions about how\ncauses vary across populations."}

In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan. All tested models, regardless of their origin, exhibit remarkably\nsimilar patterns: They produce fairly neutral responses on most topics, with\nselective progressive stances on issues such as social tolerance. Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language.

Extending Higher Order Discriminant Analysis (HODA), BTTDA uses a\nnovel and interpretable forward model for HODA combined with a deflation scheme\nto iteratively extract discriminant block terms, improving feature\nrepresentation for classification. BTTDA and a sum-of-rank-1-terms variant\nPARAFACDA were evaluated on publicly available ERP (second-order tensors) and\nMI (third-order tensors) EEG datasets from the MOABB benchmarking framework.\nBenchmarking revealed that BTTDA and PARAFACDA significantly outperform the\ntraditional HODA method in ERP decoding, resulting in state-of-the art\nperformance (ROC-AUC = 91.25%). For MI, decoding results of HODA, BTTDA and\nPARAFACDA were subpar, but BTTDA still significantly outperformed HODA (64.52%\n> 61.00%). The block-term structure of BTTDA enables interpretable and more\nefficient dimensionality reduction without compromising discriminative power.\nThis offers a promising and adaptable approach for feature extraction in BCI\nand broader neuroimaging applications."}

We study decentralized\nmulti-agent SSPs (Dec-MASSPs) under linear function approximation, where the\ntransition dynamics and costs are represented using linear models. Applying\nnovel symmetry-based arguments, we identify the structure of optimal policies.\nOur main contribution is the first regret lower bound for this setting based on\nthe construction of hard-to-learn instances for any number of agents, $n$. Our\nregret lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{K})$, over $K$ episodes, highlights the\ninherent learning difficulty in Dec-MASSPs.

Classical Test Theory analysis\nreveals that 55\\% of items achieve excellent discrimination ($D \\geq 0.40$)\nwhile 30\\% demonstrate poor discrimination ($D < 0.20$) requiring replacement.\nQuestion 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful\ndiscriminator, achieving perfect discrimination ($D = 1.000$), highest ANOVA\nF-statistic ($F = 4609.1$), and maximum Random Forest feature importance\n(0.206), accounting for 20.6\\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms\ndemonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting\nachieving 97.5\\% and 96.0\\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering\nidentifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\\%,\ndiverging from the institutional threshold of 55\\% and suggesting potential\noverclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits\nexceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster\npurity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements:\nreplace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and\nintegrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These\nfindings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical\nfoundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

This provides a framework\nto rigourously compare online SGD with some of its popular variants. We show\nthat the scaling limits of SGD-M coincide with those of online SGD after an\nappropriate time rescaling and a specific choice of step-size. However, if the\nstep-size is kept the same between the two algorithms, SGD-M will amplify\nhigh-dimensional effects, potentially degrading performance relative to online\nSGD. We demonstrate our framework on two popular learning problems: Spiked\nTensor PCA and Single Index Models. In both cases, we also examine online SGD\nwith an adaptive step-size based on normalized gradients. In the\nhigh-dimensional regime, this algorithm yields multiple benefits: its dynamics\nadmit fixed points closer to the population minimum and widens the range of\nadmissible step-sizes for which the iterates converge to such solutions. These\nexamples provide a rigorous account, aligning with empirical motivation, of how\nearly preconditioners can stabilize and improve dynamics in settings where\nonline SGD fails."}

These systems are\nnaturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the\nlink between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus\ninformation-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) --\nintractable. In addition, the dynamical nature of the system requires online\nalgorithms that update posterior distributions and select designs sequentially\nin a computationally efficient manner. We address these challenges by deriving\nnew estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent\nstates, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our\napproach leverages nested particle filters (NPFs) for efficient online\ninference with convergence guarantees.
