However, this design presents\nchallenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its\nnon-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To\naddress this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions\nusing a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy\nwhile reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a\nsimplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths\nwith limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate\nshort-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a\nlow-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS\nstate vector, maximizing the achievable rate.

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives.

Routine\nlaboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their\nutility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the\nsevere class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses\nthe feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever\nLifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the\ngrouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A\ncomprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126\nanalytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature\nselection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the\npatient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression\nclassifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated\nmoderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical\nclassification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).\nWhile a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall\n(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis\nwith SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven\nby non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is\nconcluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine\nlab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination\nfrom normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a\ncritical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and\nunderscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will\nrequire integration of multi-modal data sources."}

This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points.

We conducted a\nretrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins\nHealth System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208\nadmissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included\nas low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain\ninterpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on\nJHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.\nThe model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over\nthe current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained\nscore optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR\nvariables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the\nperformance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression\n(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk\nlabelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health\nsystems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and\npatient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to\nimproved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings."}

Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for\nonline anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments."}

The\nkey challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality\nwhile learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on\nthe cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal\ndistributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct\nmeaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)\nmixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the\nmost prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates\nincreasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we\npropose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically\nachieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation\nlearning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality\nfollows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP\nto calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows\nDP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most\nprominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating\nmultimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.\nAblation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning\nmodality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.\nCode is anonymously available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/DPMM.git"}

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons.

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning."}

We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does\nnot necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with\nreverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).\nInstead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal\ntarget distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode\ncoverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,\nand relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we\nshow commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal\nverifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the\noptimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these\ninsights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified\nalgorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a\ntarget distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling\nmodes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large\nLanguage Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality\nand diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both\nforward and reverse KL when using either naively fails."}
