Current\nalignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may\nprove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing\ntop-down controls.\n  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can\ndevelop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate\nboth when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might\ncontribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in\nempathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:\n(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these\npatterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?\n  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative\nbehaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,\nevaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror\nNeuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and\npropose a theoretical framework for further study.\n  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and\nself/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to\nbiological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative\nbehavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron\ndynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding\nempathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures."}

These limits can be avoided by measuring the\noncoming grade in real-time using on-board lidar sensors.

To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

In this paper, we introduce a combined\nAdaptive Compressed IF-TEM (ACIF-TEM) -- a new sampler that leverages the two\nmachines, AIF-TEM and CIF-TEM, where each reinforces the effectiveness of the\nother. We propose an efficient adaptive clockless time-to-digital converter\n(TDC) architecture for the novel sampler that integrates the compression stage\nwithin the TDC, facilitating the realization of the intended integrated system.\n\\ifconf \\else We analyze the total bit usage, and contrast its performance with\nthat of IF-TEM, AIF-TEM, and CIF-TEM.\\fi Via an evaluation study, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed ACIF-TEM sampler achieves lower Mean Square Error\n(MSE) with fewer bits, offering compression gains of at least 3-bit out of\n9-bits over AIF-TEM and 60\\% compression over IF-TEM, for fixed recovery MSE\nwith real audio signals."}

Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental\nqualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,\nPhenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an\nensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,\ninformation power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal\nscale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier\nremoval, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest\nNeighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and\nDecision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~\n0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in\nqualitative sampling decisions.

For OA and CVA\nscreening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model\nassigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically\nignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI\n[0.0-0.1]).

While linear preconditioners are often\nsufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has\nexplored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as\ncomponents of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical\nstudies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling\nefficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt\ntheir architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC\nsimilarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or\nsuperior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose\na factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by\ncombining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to\ntarget geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are\napproximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional\nNF models more complex dimensions.

However, to our knowledge, no study\nto date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually\nhelps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap.

Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human\nteachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT\nmodels.
