While many works study algorithms for optimizing such a programmable channel, relatively little is known about fundamental bounds on the achievable information transfer. In particular, non-trivial bounds that are both electromagnetically consistent (e.g., aware of mutual coupling) and in line with realistic hardware constraints (e.g., few-bit-programmable, potentially lossy loads) are missing. Here, based on a rigorous multiport network model of a single-input single-output (SISO) channel parametrized by 1-bit-programmable RIS elements, we apply a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to derive a fundamental bound on the achievable SISO channel gain enhancement. A bound on the maximum achievable rate of information transfer at a given noise level follows directly from Shannon's theorem. We apply our bound to several numerical and experimental examples of different RIS-parametrized radio environments. Compared to electromagnetically consistent benchmark bounding strategies (a norm-inequality bound and, where applicable, a relaxation to an idealized beyond-diagonal load network for which a global solution exists), we consistently observe that our SDR-based bound is notably tighter. We reach at least 64 % (but often 100 %) of our SDR-based bound with standard discrete optimization techniques. The applicability of our bound to concrete experimental systems makes it valuable to inform wireless practitioners, e.g., to evaluate RIS hardware design choices and algorithms to optimize the RIS configuration. Our work contributes to the development of an electromagnetic information theory for RIS-parametrized channels as well as other programmable wave systems such as dynamic metasurface antennas or real-life beyond-diagonal RISs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Fairness auditing addresses these risks through two primary functions: certification, which verifies adherence to fairness constraints; and flagging, which isolates specific demographic groups experiencing disparate treatment. However, existing auditing techniques are frequently limited by restrictive distributional assumptions or prohibitive computational overhead. We propose a novel empirical likelihood-based (EL) framework that constructs robust statistical measures for model performance disparities.

This framework uses a constrained optimization profile that admits stable numerical solutions, facilitating both large-scale certification and efficient subpopulation discovery. Empirically, the EL methods outperform bootstrap-based approaches, yielding coverage rates closer to nominal levels while reducing computational latency by several orders of magnitude.

Each group consisted of three human participants and one bot, which was framed either as human or AI and followed one of three predefined decision strategies: unconditional cooperation, conditional cooperation, or free-riding. In our sample of 236 participants, we found that reciprocal group dynamics and behavioural inertia primarily drove cooperation. These normative mechanisms operated identically across conditions, resulting in cooperation levels that did not differ significantly between human and AI labels. Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in norm persistence in a follow-up Prisoner's Dilemma, or in participants' normative perceptions. Participants' behaviour followed the same normative logic across human and AI conditions, indicating that cooperation depended on group behaviour rather than partner identity. This supports a pattern of normative equivalence, in which the mechanisms that sustain cooperation function similarly in mixed human-AI and all human groups. These findings suggest that cooperative norms are flexible enough to extend to artificial agents, blurring the boundary between humans and AI in collective decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity.

In this study, we extend that framework to a multi-objective optimization that uses the Pareto Envelope Augmented with Reinforcement Learning (PEARL) algorithm. The objectives include minimizing both the rod-integrated peaking factor ($F_{\u0394h}$) and LCOE -- subject to safety and operational constraints. We evaluate three cost scenarios: (1) a high-cost axial and drum reflectors, (2) a low-cost axial reflector, and (3) low-cost axial and drum reflectors. Our findings indicate that reducing the solid moderator radius, pin pitch, and drum coating angle -- all while increasing the fuel height -- effectively lowers $F_{\u0394h}$. Across all three scenarios, four key strategies consistently emerged for optimizing LCOE: (1) minimizing the axial reflector contribution when costly, (2) reducing control drum reliance, (3) substituting expensive tri-structural isotropic (TRISO) fuel with axial reflector material priced at the level of graphite, and (4) maximizing fuel burnup.

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords.

Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy.

Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus.

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based.

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem.

We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure.
