Due to the incorporation of the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) and despreading/mapping, an interesting and counter-intuitive cancellation of the unwanted combination of the channel induced interference with the orthogonality approximation error is seen in the filtered TD, a process which does not occur in the affine domain. The direct impact on bit error rate (BER) provides a thorough validation of the proposed analysis and explains the substantial gains in performance of the filtered TD detection scheme as opposed to its affine domain equivalent"}

Existing analyses often rely on Gaussian approximations and overlook fading effects, which limits their accuracy. This paper presents an accurate analytical framework for optimal bit detection in TNC systems under Rician fading. Using chi-squared statistics, we derive the optimal maximum-likelihood detection threshold and an expression for the bit error probability (BEP) via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. The proposed model eliminates approximation errors and accurately characterizes performance for finite sample sizes. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the analytical results and demonstrate significant improvements in BEP compared with suboptimal Gaussian-based detection. Furthermore, the influence of key parameters, sample size, resistance ratio, and Rician K-factor, is quantified. The proposed framework provides a solid foundation for designing energy-efficient TNC receivers in future B5G/6G and large-scale IoT systems."}

We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search."}

In this work, we extract, process, and visualize latent state geometries in Transformer-based language models through dimensionality reduction. We capture layerwise activations at multiple points within Transformer blocks and enable systematic analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation (UMAP). We demonstrate experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMa models, where we uncover interesting geometric patterns in latent space. Notably, we identify a clear separation between attention and MLP component outputs across intermediate layers, a pattern not documented in prior work to our knowledge. We also characterize the high norm of latent states at the initial sequence position and visualize the layerwise evolution of latent states. Additionally, we demonstrate the high-dimensional helical structure of GPT-2's positional embeddings, the sequence-wise geometric patterns in LLaMa, and experiment with repeating token sequences. We aim to support systematic analysis of Transformer internals with the goal of enabling further reproducible interpretability research.

We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and each other. We find the LLM judge to be highly effective at detecting reward hacking in unambiguous cases, and observe only minimal improvement from the use of held out test cases. In addition to testing many models using Inspect's basic_agent scaffold, we also measure reward hacking rates for three popular proprietary coding agents: OpenAI's Codex, Anthropic's Claude Code, and Google's Gemini CLI Using GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, respectively. We observe explicit reward hacking by both Codex and Claude Code, and misaligned behavior by all three agents. Our codebase can be found at https://github.com/JonathanGabor/EvilGenie."}
