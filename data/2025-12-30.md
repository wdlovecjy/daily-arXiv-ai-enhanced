Abstract: This article addresses the fuzzy logistic regression model under conditions of multicollinearity, which causes instability and inflated variance in parameter estimation. In this model, both the response variable and parameters are represented as fuzzy triangular numbers. To overcome the multicollinearity problem, various Liu-type estimators were employed: Fuzzy Maximum Likelihood Estimators (FMLE), Fuzzy Logistic Ridge Estimators (FLRE), Fuzzy Logistic Liu Estimators (FLLE), Fuzzy Logistic Liu-type Estimators (FLLTE), and Fuzzy Logistic Liu-type Parameter Estimators (FLLTPE). Through simulations with various sample sizes and application to real fuzzy data on kidney failure, model performance was evaluated using mean square error (MSE) and goodness of fit criteria. Results demonstrated superior performance of FLLTPE and FLLTE compared to other estimators.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As AI systems are increasingly used to guide decisions, it is essential that they follow ethical principles. A core principle in medicine is non-maleficence, often equated with ``do no harm''. A formal definition of harm based on counterfactual reasoning has been proposed and popularized. This notion of harm has been promoted in simple settings with binary treatments and outcomes. Here, we highlight a problem with this definition in settings involving multiple treatment options. Illustrated by an example with three tuberculosis treatments (say, A, B, and C), we demonstrate that the counterfactual definition of harm can produce intransitive results: B is less harmful than A, C is less harmful than B, yet C is more harmful than A when compared pairwise. This intransitivity poses a challenge as it may lead to practical (clinical) decisions that are difficult to justify or defend. In contrast, an interventionist definition of harm based on expected utility forgoes counterfactual comparisons and ensures transitive treatment rankings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proficient in perception and instruction-following, but they still struggle with spatial reasoning: the ability to mentally track and manipulate objects across multiple views and over time. Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding. These contributions establish a standardized framework for evaluating geometric understanding and spatial reasoning in MLLMs. Dataset and code: https://github.com/stvngo/GamiBench.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems present both significant opportunities and novel risks due to their capacity for autonomous action, encompassing tasks such as code execution, internet interaction, and file modification. This poses considerable challenges for effective organizational governance, particularly in comprehensively identifying, assessing, and mitigating diverse and evolving risks. To tackle this, we introduce the Agentic Risk \& Capability (ARC) Framework, a technical governance framework designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI systems. The framework's core contributions are: (1) it develops a novel capability-centric perspective to analyze a wide range of agentic AI systems; (2) it distills three primary sources of risk intrinsic to agentic AI systems - components, design, and capabilities; (3) it establishes a clear nexus between each risk source, specific materialized risks, and corresponding technical controls; and (4) it provides a structured and practical approach to help organizations implement the framework. This framework provides a robust and adaptable methodology for organizations to navigate the complexities of agentic AI, enabling rapid and effective innovation while ensuring the safe, secure, and responsible deployment of agentic AI systems. Our framework is open-sourced \href{https://govtech-responsibleai.github.io/agentic-risk-capability-framework/}{here}.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language reasoning but remain unreliable on tasks requiring strict rule adherence, determinism, and auditability. Logic Sketch Prompting (LSP) is a lightweight prompting framework that introduces typed variables, deterministic condition evaluators, and a rule based validator that produces traceable and repeatable outputs. Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01). These results demonstrate that LSP improves determinism, interpretability, and consistency without sacrificing performance, supporting its use in clinical, regulated, and safety critical decision support systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Numeric planning with control parameters extends the standard numeric planning model by introducing action parameters as free numeric variables that must be instantiated during planning. This results in a potentially infinite number of applicable actions in a state. In this setting, off-the-shelf numeric heuristics that leverage the action structure are not feasible. In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\%--89.7\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities in planning and tool use. Travel planning provides a natural and high-impact testbed for these capabilities, as it requires multi-step reasoning, iterative preference elicitation through interaction, and calls to external tools under evolving constraints. Prior work has studied LLMs on travel-planning tasks, but existing settings are limited in domain coverage and multi-turn interaction. As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance. TravelBench offers a practical and reproducible benchmark for advancing LLM agents in travel planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for continual and experiential learning in large language model agents that integrates episodic memory with reinforcement learning. The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Portfolio optimization in non-stationary markets is challenging due to regime shifts, dynamic correlations, and the limited interpretability of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\% higher Return, 5\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners. The source code, full appendices, and all experimental data are available for reproducibility at the official project repository.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the connection of two problems within the planning and verification community: Conformant planning and model-checking of hyperproperties. Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution. Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces of a system and, e.g., capture information-flow and fairness policies. In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\exists^*\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that "the world is bigger" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.

Abstract: We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equations in time domain with exact temporal derivatives. While PINNs do not outperform SPICE in speed or accuracy during training, they offer unique advantages such as surrogate models for design optimization and inverse problems. NeuroSPICE's flexibility enables the simulation of emerging devices, including highly nonlinear systems such as ferroelectric memories.

Abstract: Across fields such as machine learning, social science, geography, considerable attention has been given to models that factorize a nonnegative matrix into the product of two or three matrices, subject to nonnegative or row-sum-to-1 constraints. Although these models are to a large extend similar or even equivalent, they are presented under different names, and their similarity is not well known. This paper highlights similarities among five popular models, latent budget analysis (LBA), latent class analysis (LCA), end-member analysis (EMA), probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We focus on an essential issue-identifiability-of these models and prove that the solution of LBA, EMA, LCA, PLSA is unique if and only if the solution of NMF is unique. We also provide a brief review for algorithms of these models. We illustrate the models with a time budget dataset from social science, and end the paper with a discussion of closely related models such as archetypal analysis.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nature rarely reveals her secrets bluntly, yet in the Fibonacci sequence she grants us a glimpse of her quiet architecture of growth, harmony, and recursive stability \citep{Koshy2001Fibonacci, Livio2002GoldenRatio}. From spiral galaxies to the unfolding of leaves, this humble sequence reflects a universal grammar of balance. In this work, we introduce \emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization. These findings suggest that Fibonacci ensembles form a natural and interpretable design point within the broader theory of ensemble learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformers empirically perform precise probabilistic reasoning in carefully constructed ``Bayesian wind tunnels'' and in large-scale language models, yet the mechanisms by which gradient-based learning creates the required internal geometry remain opaque. We provide a complete first-order analysis of how cross-entropy training reshapes attention scores and value vectors in a transformer attention head. Our core result is an \emph{advantage-based routing law} for attention scores, \[ \frac{\partial L}{\partial s_{ij}} = α_{ij}\bigl(b_{ij}-\mathbb{E}_{α_i}[b]\bigr), \qquad b_{ij} := u_i^\top v_j, \] coupled with a \emph{responsibility-weighted update} for values, \[ Δv_j = -η\sum_i α_{ij} u_i, \] where $u_i$ is the upstream gradient at position $i$ and $α_{ij}$ are attention weights. These equations induce a positive feedback loop in which routing and content specialize together: queries route more strongly to values that are above-average for their error signal, and those values are pulled toward the queries that use them. We show that this coupled specialization behaves like a two-timescale EM procedure: attention weights implement an E-step (soft responsibilities), while values implement an M-step (responsibility-weighted prototype updates), with queries and keys adjusting the hypothesis frame. Through controlled simulations, including a sticky Markov-chain task where we compare a closed-form EM-style update to standard SGD, we demonstrate that the same gradient dynamics that minimize cross-entropy also sculpt the low-dimensional manifolds identified in our companion work as implementing Bayesian inference. This yields a unified picture in which optimization (gradient flow) gives rise to geometry (Bayesian manifolds), which in turn supports function (in-context probabilistic reasoning).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern machine learning embeddings provide powerful compression of high-dimensional data, yet they typically destroy the geometric structure required for classical likelihood-based statistical inference. This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.

Abstract: Causal inference is a key research area in machine learning, yet confusion reigns over the tools needed to tackle it. There are prevalent claims in the machine learning literature that you need a bespoke causal framework or notation to answer causal questions. In this paper, we want to make it clear that you \emph{can} answer any causal inference question within the realm of probabilistic modelling and inference, without causal-specific tools or notation. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how causal questions can be tackled by writing down the probability of everything. Lastly, we reinterpret causal tools as emerging from standard probabilistic modelling and inference, elucidating their necessity and utility.

Abstract: We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.

Abstract: We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant paradigm for learning on graph-structured data, thanks to their ability to jointly exploit node features and relational information encoded in the graph topology. This joint modeling, however, also introduces a critical weakness: perturbations or noise in either the structure or the features can be amplified through message passing, making GNNs highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks and spurious connections. In this work, we introduce a pruning framework that leverages adversarial robustness evaluation to explicitly identify and remove fragile or detrimental components of the graph. By using robustness scores as guidance, our method selectively prunes edges that are most likely to degrade model reliability, thereby yielding cleaner and more resilient graph representations. We instantiate this framework on three representative GNN architectures and conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly enhance the defense capability of GNNs in the high-perturbation regime.

Abstract: Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.

Abstract: The integration of physics-based knowledge with machine learning models is increasingly shaping the monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of electrical transformers. In this two-part series, the first paper introduced the foundations of Neural Networks (NNs) and their variants for health assessment tasks. This second paper focuses on integrating physics and uncertainty into the learning process. We begin with the fundamentals of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), applied to spatiotemporal thermal modeling and solid insulation ageing. Building on this, we present Bayesian PINNs as a principled framework to quantify epistemic uncertainty and deliver robust predictions under sparse data. Finally, we outline emerging research directions that highlight the potential of physics-aware and trustworthy machine learning for critical power assets.

Abstract: Power transformers are critical assets in power networks, whose reliability directly impacts grid resilience and stability. Traditional condition monitoring approaches, often rule-based or purely physics-based, struggle with uncertainty, limited data availability, and the complexity of modern operating conditions. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) provide powerful tools to complement and extend these methods, enabling more accurate diagnostics, prognostics, and control. In this two-part series, we examine the role of Neural Networks (NNs) and their extensions in transformer condition monitoring and health management tasks. This first paper introduces the basic concepts of NNs, explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for condition monitoring using diverse data modalities, and discusses the integration of NN concepts within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm for decision-making and control. Finally, perspectives on emerging research directions are also provided.

Abstract: The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this "extrinsic maximization" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.

Abstract: Since transformer was firstly published in 2017, several works have been proposed to optimize it. However, the major structure of transformer remains unchanged, ignoring one of its main intrinsic limitations, which is the same static value is used for every query in a head. Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.

Abstract: Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve strong performance on homophilic graphs but often struggle under heterophily, where adjacent nodes frequently belong to different classes. We propose an interpretable and adaptive framework for semi-supervised node classification based on explicit combinatorial inference rather than deep message passing. Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes.
  We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol. Experiments on heterophilic and transitional benchmarks demonstrate competitive performance with modern GNNs while offering advantages in interpretability, tunability, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Mycotoxin contamination poses a significant risk to cereal crop quality, food safety, and agricultural productivity. Accurate prediction of mycotoxin levels can support early intervention strategies and reduce economic losses. This study investigates the use of neural networks and transfer learning models to predict mycotoxin contamination in Irish oat crops as a multi-response prediction task. Our dataset comprises oat samples collected in Ireland, containing a mix of environmental, agronomic, and geographical predictors. Five modelling approaches were evaluated: a baseline multilayer perceptron (MLP), an MLP with pre-training, and three transfer learning models; TabPFN, TabNet, and FT-Transformer. Model performance was evaluated using regression (RMSE, $R^2$) and classification (AUC, F1) metrics, with results reported per toxin and on average. Additionally, permutation-based variable importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential predictors across both prediction tasks. The transfer learning approach TabPFN provided the overall best performance, followed by the baseline MLP. Our variable importance analysis revealed that weather history patterns in the 90-day pre-harvest period were the most important predictors, alongside seed moisture content.

Abstract: Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \sum_k b_k \mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\{μ_k, λ_k\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure. Our results demonstrate that theory-guided architectural design can yield dramatic improvements for scientifically-motivated function classes.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning can dramatically impact training stability and final performance of large-scale models. Recent works on neural network parameterisations, such as $μ$P, have enabled transfer of optimal global hyperparameters across model sizes. These works propose an empirical practice of search for optimal global base hyperparameters at a small model size, and transfer to a large size. We extend these works in two key ways. To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers. Our experiments demonstrate significant training speed improvements in Large Language Models with the transferred per-module hyperparameters.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from graph-structured data, but their application to large graphs is hindered by computational costs. The need to process every neighbor for each node creates memory and computational bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce BLISS, a Bandit Layer Importance Sampling Strategy. It uses multi-armed bandits to dynamically select the most informative nodes at each layer, balancing exploration and exploitation to ensure comprehensive graph coverage. Unlike existing static sampling methods, BLISS adapts to evolving node importance, leading to more informed node selection and improved performance. It demonstrates versatility by integrating with both Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), adapting its selection policy to their specific aggregation mechanisms. Experiments show that BLISS maintains or exceeds the accuracy of full-batch training.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to Auto-Regressive (AR) models. While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data. Our model achieves state-of-the-art math performance among dLLMs and surpasses comparable models in the Qwen2.5 series on several benchmarks.

Abstract: While modern multivariate forecasters such as Transformers and GNNs achieve strong benchmark performance, they often suffer from systematic errors at specific variables or horizons and, critically, lack guarantees against performance degradation in deployment. Existing post-hoc residual correction methods attempt to fix these errors, but are inherently greedy: although they may improve average accuracy, they can also "help in the wrong way" by overcorrecting reliable predictions and causing local failures in unseen scenarios.
  To address this critical "safety gap," we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.
  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Transformers often appear to perform Bayesian reasoning in context, but verifying this rigorously has been impossible: natural data lack analytic posteriors, and large models conflate reasoning with memorization. We address this by constructing \emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with \mbox{$10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}$} bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation.
  Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query--key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \emph{frame--precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses.
  Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures. Bayesian wind tunnels provide a foundation for mechanistically connecting small, verifiable systems to reasoning phenomena observed in large language models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.
  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.
  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.

Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in adults worldwide. Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB. Our findings highlight the importance of improving and monitoring model performance across underrepresented subgroups, and further research on algorithmic fairness, in lung cancer screening.

Abstract: In machine learning, the loss functions optimized during training often differ from the target loss that defines task performance due to computational intractability or lack of differentiability. We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds.
  We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms.
  We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.

Abstract: Policy gradient methods for large language models optimize a surrogate objective computed from samples of a rollout policy $π_{\text{roll}}$. When $π_{\text{roll}} \ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.

Abstract: Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face dual challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shifts caused by signal drift and decision failures induced by unknown interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively resolves the trade-off between accuracy and stability, providing a solid technical foundation for industrial E-nose deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) faces a fundamental tension: high-throughput inference engines and numerically-precise training systems produce different probability distributions from the same parameters, creating a training-inference mismatch. We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.

Abstract: Unsupervised human motion segmentation (HMS) can be effectively achieved using subspace clustering techniques. However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.

Abstract: Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$.
  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\sqrt{T \log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.

Abstract: Blind inverse problems arise in many experimental settings where the forward operator is partially or entirely unknown. In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.

Abstract: PNNs present promising opportunities for accelerating machine learning by leveraging the unique benefits of photonic circuits. However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures. By addressing key computational bottlenecks, LuxIA facilitates broader adoption and accelerates innovation in AI hardware through photonic technologies. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable photonic neural network research and development.

Abstract: Distribution shift is the defining challenge of real-world machine learning. The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing "negative transfer" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].
  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.

Abstract: We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory.
  We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance. These methods provide a practical alternative to explicit signature computations, retaining their inductive bias while benefiting from the efficiency of random features.

Abstract: Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms. We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary. Our results suggest that deterministic memory is a necessary primitive for trustworthy AI systems. The reference implementation is open-source and available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel (archived at https://zenodo.org/records/18022660).

Abstract: A central question for the future of work is whether person centered management can survive when algorithms take on managerial roles. Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Warning-framed content in training data (e.g., "DO NOT USE - this code is vulnerable") does not, it turns out, teach language models to avoid the warned-against behavior. In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: "describing X" and "performing X" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call "stealth slip", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.

Abstract: Ensemble learning of LLMs has emerged as a promising alternative to enhance performance, but existing approaches typically treat models as black boxes, combining the inputs or final outputs while overlooking the rich internal representations and interactions across models.In this work, we introduce LLMBoost, a novel ensemble fine-tuning framework that breaks this barrier by explicitly leveraging intermediate states of LLMs. Inspired by the boosting paradigm, LLMBoost incorporates three key innovations. First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.

Abstract: Closed-loop decision-making systems (e.g., lending, screening, or recidivism risk assessment) often operate under fairness and service constraints while inducing feedback effects: decisions change who appears in the future, yielding non-stationary data and potentially amplifying disparities. We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.
  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.
  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.

Abstract: Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.

Abstract: Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. However, its linear adaptation process limits its expressive power. This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Numerous studies attempt to mitigate classification bias caused by class imbalance. However, existing studies have yet to explore the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. This constraint hinders further performance improvements. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training. Extensive experiments on 20 public imbalanced datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines. The code for the proposed model is available at: https://github.com/ChuantaoLi/DARG.

Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) suggests that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse subnetworks ("winning tickets") capable of matching full model performance when trained from scratch. With the growing reliance on fine-tuning large pretrained models, we investigate whether LTH extends to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), specifically focusing on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods. Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy. Our results not only deepen our theoretical understanding of transfer learning and the interplay between pretraining and fine-tuning but also open new avenues for developing more efficient adaptation strategies.

Abstract: According to the advent of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, many investments and businesses are now conducted online through cryptocurrencies. Among them, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology to make transactions secure, transparent, traceable, and immutable. It also exhibits significant price fluctuations and performance, which has attracted substantial attention, especially in financial sectors. Consequently, a wide range of investors and individuals have turned to investing in the cryptocurrency market. One of the most important challenges in economics is price forecasting for future trades. Cryptocurrencies are no exception, and investors are looking for methods to predict prices; various theories and methods have been proposed in this field. This paper presents a new deep model, called \emph{Parallel Gated Recurrent Units} (PGRU), for cryptocurrency price prediction. In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively. Our method therefore attains higher accuracy and efficiency with fewer input data and lower computational cost compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The global gold market, by its fundamentals, has long been home to many financial institutions, banks, governments, funds, and micro-investors. Due to the inherent complexity and relationship between important economic and political components, accurate forecasting of financial markets has always been challenging. Therefore, providing a model that can accurately predict the future of the markets is very important and will be of great benefit to their developers. In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries. Our proposed LSTM-MLP model predicted the daily closing price of gold with the Mean absolute error (MAE) of $ 0.21 and the next month's price with $ 22.23.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments, aiming to extract common features from related tasks. While centralized approaches have been extensively studied, decentralized methods remain largely underexplored. We study decentralized multi-task representation learning in which the features share a low-rank structure. We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis across different dimensions and network topologies, and demonstrate regimes in which decentralized learning outperforms centralized federated approaches.

Abstract: Existing machine learning frameworks operate over the field of real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$) and learn representations in real (Euclidean or Hilbert) vector spaces (e.g., $\mathbb{R}^d$). Their underlying geometric properties align well with intuitive concepts such as linear separability, minimum enclosing balls, and subspace projection; and basic calculus provides a toolbox for learning through gradient-based optimization.
  But is this the only possible choice? In this paper, we study the suitability of a radically different field as an alternative to $\mathbb{R}$ -- the ultrametric and non-archimedean space of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$. The hierarchical structure of the $p$-adics and their interpretation as infinite strings make them an appealing tool for code theory and hierarchical representation learning. Our exploratory theoretical work establishes the building blocks for classification, regression, and representation learning with the $p$-adics, providing learning models and algorithms. We illustrate how simple Quillian semantic networks can be represented as a compact $p$-adic linear network, a construction which is not possible with the field of reals. We finish by discussing open problems and opportunities for future research enabled by this new framework.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel learning-based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach specifically targets low-probability, high-consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records (2014-2024) with weather, socio-economic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals underlying patterns of community vulnerability and provides a clearer understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models (Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) are evaluated. Experimental validation is performed on a large-scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves the lowest prediction error. Additionally, the results demonstrate that stronger economic conditions and more developed infrastructure are associated with lower outage occurrence.

Abstract: Deep learning models have grown increasingly popular in time series applications. However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.

Abstract: Long-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models faces critical scalability challenges from unbounded context growth, leading to context folding methods that compress interaction history during task execution. However, existing approaches treat summary actions as standard actions, overlooking that summaries fundamentally modify the agent's future observation space, creating a policy-dependent, non-stationary observation distribution that violates core RL assumptions. This introduces three fundamental challenges: (1) gradient dilution where summary tokens receive insufficient training signal, (2) self-conditioning where policy updates change summary distributions, creating a vicious cycle of training collapse, and (3) computational cost from processing unique contexts at each turn. We introduce \textbf{FoldAct}\footnote{https://github.com/SHAO-Jiaqi757/FoldAct}, a framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through three key innovations: separated loss computation for independent gradient signals on summary and action tokens, full context consistency loss to reduce distribution shift, and selective segment training to reduce computational cost. Our method enables stable training of long-horizon search agents with context folding, addressing the non-stationary observation problem while improving training efficiency with 5.19$\times$ speedup.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) assumes related material properties share underlying physics that can be leveraged for better predictions. We test this by simultaneously predicting electrical resistivity, Vickers hardness, and amorphous-forming ability using 54,028 alloy samples. We compare single-task models against standard and structured MTL. Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%). Analysis shows near-zero inter-task weights, indicating property independence. Regression failure is attributed to negative transfer caused by severe data imbalance (52k vs. 800 samples). We recommend independent models for precise regression, while reserving MTL for classification tasks where recall is critical.

Abstract: Childhood obesity remains a major public health challenge in the United States, strongly influenced by a combination of individual-level, household-level, and environmental-level risk factors. Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.

Abstract: Deep Q-learning algorithms remain notoriously unstable, especially during early training when the maximization operator amplifies estimation errors. Inspired by bounded rationality theory and developmental learning, we introduce Sat-EnQ, a two-phase framework that first learns to be ``good enough'' before optimizing aggressively. In Phase 1, we train an ensemble of lightweight Q-networks under a satisficing objective that limits early value growth using a dynamic baseline, producing diverse, low-variance estimates while avoiding catastrophic overestimation. In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles. Our results highlight a principled path toward robust reinforcement learning by embracing satisficing before optimization.

Abstract: Two divergence regimes dominate modern alignment practice. Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved significant success in solving single-goal tasks. However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning that integrates Imitation Learning and Reinforcement Learning. By analyzing the gradient of a composite objective combining trajectory-level KL divergence with task rewards, we derive a natural decomposition into two components: (1) an analytically computable Dense Gradient for token-level imitation, and (2) a Monte Carlo estimated Sparse Gradient for long-horizon reward optimization. The Dense Gradient admits a closed-form logit-level formula, enabling efficient GPU implementation.

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging is a critical task in healthcare due to the global prevalence of sleep disorders. This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of models on decentralized data, but its performance degrades significantly under Non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data conditions. While this accuracy loss is well-documented, the internal mechanistic causes remain a black box. This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model. Our findings reframe the problem of statistical drift in FL as a concrete, observable failure of mechanistic preservation, paving the way for more targeted solutions.

Abstract: While it is well-established that the weight matrices and feature manifolds of deep neural networks exhibit a low Intrinsic Dimension (ID), current state-of-the-art models still rely on massive high-dimensional widths. This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical systems, and recent multimodal foundation models have shown promise for learning PDE solution operators across diverse equation families. However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a practical solution for adapting large foundation models to downstream tasks, reducing computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of parameters. Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.

Abstract: Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

Abstract: In this article, we consider an industrial internet of things (IIoT) network supporting multi-device dynamic ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) while the channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. A joint link adaptation (LA) and device scheduling (including the order) design is provided, aiming at maximizing the total transmission rate under strict block error rate (BLER) constraints. In particular, a Bayesian optimization (BO) driven Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) method is proposed, which determines the device served order sequence and the corresponding modulation and coding scheme (MCS) adaptively based on the imperfect CSI. Note that the imperfection of CSI, error sample imbalance in URLLC networks, as well as the parameter sensitivity nature of the TD3 algorithm likely diminish the algorithm's convergence speed and reliability. To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem. Via extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and higher sum-rate performance compared to existing solutions.

Abstract: Multi-model routing has evolved from an engineering technique into essential infrastructure, yet existing work lacks a systematic, reproducible benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs). We present VL-RouterBench to assess the overall capability of VLM routing systems systematically. The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.

Abstract: Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.

Abstract: Weak signal learning (WSL) is a common challenge in many fields like fault diagnosis, medical imaging, and autonomous driving, where critical information is often masked by noise and interference, making feature identification difficult. Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.

Abstract: Representation learning is a widely adopted framework for learning in data-scarce environments to obtain a feature extractor or representation from various different yet related tasks. Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion. We obtain constructive, provable guarantees that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity and an upper bound on the iteration complexity of our proposed algorithm. We analyze the time and communication complexity of our algorithm and show that it is fast and communication-efficient. We performed numerical simulations to validate the performance of our algorithm and compared it with benchmark algorithms.

Abstract: We systematically evaluate Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods under the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). RLVR incentivizes language models to enhance their reasoning capabilities through verifiable feedback; however, while methods like LoRA are commonly used, the optimal PEFT architecture for RLVR remains unidentified. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization. Furthermore, our ablations reveal that extreme parameter reduction (\textit{e.g.,} VeRA, Rank-1) severely bottlenecks reasoning capacity. We further conduct ablation studies and scaling experiments to validate our findings. This work provides a definitive guide for advocating for more exploration for parameter-efficient RL methods.

Abstract: Intro: Vocal cord ultrasound (VCUS) has emerged as a less invasive and better tolerated examination technique, but its accuracy is operator dependent. This research aims to apply a machine learning-assisted algorithm to automatically identify the vocal cords and distinguish normal vocal cord images from vocal cord paralysis (VCP). Methods: VCUS videos were acquired from 30 volunteers, which were split into still frames and cropped to a uniform size. Healthy and simulated VCP images were used as training data for vocal cord segmentation and VCP classification models. Results: The vocal cord segmentation model achieved a validation accuracy of 96%, while the best classification model (VIPRnet) achieved a validation accuracy of 99%. Conclusion: Machine learning-assisted analysis of VCUS shows great promise in improving diagnostic accuracy over operator-dependent human interpretation.

Abstract: While Transformers have demonstrated remarkable potential in modeling Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), modeling large-scale unstructured meshes with complex geometries remains a significant challenge. Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving paradigm for training machine learning models across distributed edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks with hard constraints (HC-PINNs) are increasingly favored for their ability to strictly enforce boundary conditions via a trial function ansatz $\tilde{u} = A + B \cdot N$, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing their training dynamics have remained unexplored.
  Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape.
  A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law.
  This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel.
  Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers.
  It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction.
  Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.

Abstract: This document is a follow-up to our previous paper dedicated to a vectorized derivation of backpropagation in CNNs. Following the same principles and notations already put in place there, we now focus on transformer-based next-token-prediction architectures. To this end, we apply our lightweight index-free methodology to new types of layers such as embedding, multi-headed self-attention and layer normalization. In addition, we also provide gradient expressions for LoRA layers to illustrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Why bother doing manual backpropagation when there are so many tools that do this automatically? Any gap in understanding of how values propagate forward will become evident when attempting to differentiate the loss function. By working through the backward pass manually, we gain a deeper intuition for how each operation influences the final output. A complete PyTorch implementation of a minimalistic GPT-like network is also provided along with analytical expressions for of all of its gradient updates.

Abstract: This note introduces Isometric Policy Optimization (ISOPO), an efficient method to approximate the natural policy gradient in a single gradient step. In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle to learn discriminative node representations for heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar labels and feature similarity provides weak structural cues. We propose frequency-guided graph structure learning (FgGSL), an end-to-end graph inference framework that jointly learns homophilic and heterophilic graph structures along with a spectral encoder. FgGSL employs a learnable, symmetric, feature-driven masking function to infer said complementary graphs, which are processed using pre-designed low- and high-pass graph filter banks. A label-based structural loss explicitly promotes the recovery of homophilic and heterophilic edges, enabling task-driven graph structure learning. We derive stability bounds for the structural loss and establish robustness guarantees for the filter banks under graph perturbations. Experiments on six heterophilic benchmarks demonstrate that FgGSL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and graph rewiring methods, highlighting the benefits of combining frequency information with supervised topology inference.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models scale capacity but often suffer from representation collapse and gradient instability. We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

Abstract: Traditional Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for quality management but is limited by its reliance on often violated statistical assumptions, leading to unreliable monitoring in modern, complex manufacturing environments. This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.

Abstract: We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: As agriculture faces increasing pressure from water scarcity, especially in regions like Tunisia, innovative, resource-efficient solutions are urgently needed. This work explores the integration of indoor vertical hydroponics with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize basil yield while saving water. This research develops a prediction system that uses different ML models and assesses their performance. The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications. These performance trade-offs highlight the potential of DNN-based solutions for building responsive, high-accuracy decision-support systems tailored to agricultural environments, making it suitable for future edge-device deployment.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals contain rich temporal-spectral structure but are difficult to model due to noise, subject variability, and multi-scale dynamics. Lightweight deep learning models have shown promise, yet many either rely solely on local convolutions or require heavy recurrent modules. This paper presents PaperNet, a compact hybrid architecture that combines temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block which is used for short-window classification. Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process. These results indicate that carefully combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent context modeling can yield strong EEG classification performance without excessive computational cost.

Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MTs negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a fluid-active reconfigurable intelligent surface (FARIS) that combines fluid-based port repositioning with per-element active amplification to enhance the performance of 6G network. To characterize the performance, we formulate an ergodic-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes both the active amplification-reflection vector and the discrete selection of fluid active elements under practical hardware constraints. The problem is addressed via an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which progressively improves the rate. Complexity and convergence analyses that follow furnish deeper insight into the algorithmic operation and performance enhancement. Numerical results confirm that the proposed FARIS with AO framework consistently outperforms conventional FRIS/ARIS, delivering higher rates across diverse environments, often even when using fewer active elements or a smaller physical aperture.

Abstract: Semantic communication has been introduced into collaborative perception systems for autonomous driving, offering a promising approach to enhancing data transmission efficiency and robustness. Despite its potential, existing semantic communication approaches predominantly rely on analog transmission models, rendering these systems fundamentally incompatible with the digital architecture of modern vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and posing a significant barrier to real-world deployment. To bridge this critical gap, we propose CoDS, a novel collaborative perception framework based on digital semantic communication, designed to realize semantic-level transmission efficiency within practical digital communication systems. Specifically, we develop a semantic compression codec that extracts and compresses task-oriented semantic features while preserving downstream perception accuracy. Building on this, we propose a novel semantic analog-to-digital converter that converts these continuous semantic features into a discrete bitstream, ensuring integration with existing digital communication pipelines. Furthermore, we develop an uncertainty-aware network (UAN) that assesses the reliability of each received feature and discards those corrupted by decoding failures, thereby mitigating the cliff effect of conventional channel coding schemes under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoDS significantly outperforms existing semantic communication and traditional digital communication schemes, achieving state-of-the-art perception performance while ensuring compatibility with practical digital V2X systems.

Abstract: Heartbeat interval can be detected from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals in a non-contact manner. Conventional methods achieved heartbeat detection from different perspectives, where template matching (TM) and deep learning (DL) were based on the similarity of neighboring heartbeat episodes and robust spatio-temporal characteristics, respectively, and thus, performed varied from case to case. Inspired by the above facts, we propose confidence analysis-based hybrid heartbeat detection using both TM and DL, and further explore the advantages of both methods in various scenarios. To be specific, the confidence of the heartbeat detection results was evaluated by the consistency of signal morphology and the variability of the detected heartbeat intervals, which could be formulated by the averaged correlation between each heartbeat episode and the detected template and the normalized standard deviation among detected heartbeat intervals, respectively, where the results with higher confidence were remained. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method, we conducted experiments using practical clinical BCG dataset with 34 subjects including 924,235 heartbeats. Numerical results showed that the proposed hybrid method achieved an average absolute interval error of 20.73 ms, yielding a reduction of 29.28 ms and 10.13 ms compared to solo TM and DL methods, respectively. Besides, case study showed the robustness of heartbeat detection of TM and DL to individual differences and signal quality, respectively, and in turn, validated that the hybrid method could benefit from the complementary advantages of both methods, which demonstrated the superiority of the proposed hybrid method in practical BCG monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) is a recently developed, groundbreaking hardware technology with promising potential for 6G wireless systems. Unlike conventional rigid antenna array (RAA)-based transmitters, FIM-assisted transmitters can dynamically alter their physical surface through morphing, offering new degrees of freedom to enhance system performance. In this letter, we depart from prior works that rely on instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and instead address the problem of average sum spectral efficiency maximization under statistical CSI in a FIM-assisted downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output setting. To this end, we first derive the spatial correlation matrix for the FIM-aided transmitter and then propose an iterative FIM optimization algorithm based on the gradient projection method. Simulation results show that with statistical CSI, the FIM-aided system provides a significant performance gain over its RAA-based counterpart in scenarios with strong spatial channel correlation, whereas the gain diminishes when the channels are weakly correlated.

Abstract: Linear covariance (LinCov) techniques have gained widespread traction in the modeling of uncertainty, including in the preliminary study of spacecraft navigation performance. While LinCov methods offer improved computational efficiency compared to Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis, they inherently rely on linearization approximations. Understanding the fidelity of these approximations and identifying when they are deficient is critically important for spacecraft navigation and mission planning, especially when dealing with highly nonlinear systems and large state uncertainties. This work presents a number of computational techniques for assessing linear covariance performance. These new LinCov fidelity measures are formulated using higher-order statistics, constrained optimization, and the unscented transform.

Abstract: This paper integrates the emerging ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) technique with orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM) waveform to tackle the challenging near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) problem. Specifically, we conceive a comprehensive ISAC architecture, where an UM-MIMO base station adopts OCDM waveform for communications and a co-located sensing receiver adopts the frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) detection principle to simplify the associated hardware. For sensing tasks, several OCDM subcarriers, namely, dedicated sensing subcarriers (DSSs), are each transmitted through a dedicated sensing antenna (DSA) within the transmit antenna array. By judiciously designing the DSS selection scheme and optimizing receiver parameters, the FMCW-based sensing receiver can decouple the echo signals from different DSAs with significantly reduced hardware complexity. This setup enables the estimation of ranges and velocities of near-field targets in an antenna-pairwise manner. Moreover, by leveraging the spatial diversity of UM-MIMO, we introduce the concept of virtual bistatic sensing (VIBS), which incorporates the estimates from multiple antenna pairs to achieve high-accuracy target positioning and three-dimensional velocity measurement. The VIBS paradigm is immune to hostile channel environments characterized by spatial non-stationarity and uncorrelated multipath environment. Furthermore, the channel estimation of UM-MIMO OCDM systems enhanced by the sensing results is investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ISAC scheme enhances sensing accuracy, and also benefits communication performance.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been considered a promising privacy preserving distributed edge learning framework. Over-the-air computation (AirComp) technique leveraging analog transmission enables the aggregation of local updates directly over-the-air by exploiting the superposition properties of wireless multiple-access channel, thereby drastically reducing the communication bottleneck issues of FL compared with digital transmission schemes. This work points out that existing AirComp-FL overlooks a key practical constraint, the instantaneous peak-power constraints imposed by the non-linearity of radiofrequency power amplifiers. We present and analyze the effect of the classic method to deal with this issue, amplitude clipping combined with filtering. We investigate the effect of instantaneous peak-power constraints in AirComp-FL for both single-carrier and multi-carrier orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. We highlight the specificity of AirComp-FL: the samples depend on the gradient value distribution, leading to a higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) than that observed for uniformly distributed signals. Simulation results demonstrate that, in practical settings, the instantaneous transmit power regularly exceeds the power-amplifier limit; however, by applying clipping and filtering, the FL performance can be degraded. The degradation becomes pronounced especially in multi-carrier OFDM systems due to the in-band distortions caused by clipping and filtering.
