We then propose a changepoint detection\nalgorithm that combines a likelihood-based approach with split-sample inference\nto control false positives, using either nonparametric tests or tests\nappropriate to the underlying data distribution. These tests incorporate a\nshift parameter, allowing users to specify the minimum magnitude of change to\ndetect. We demonstrate the utility of this approach across several baseball\napplications: detecting changes in batter plate discipline metrics (e.g., chase\nand whiff rate), identifying velocity changes in pitcher fastballs, and\nvalidating velocity changepoints against a curated ground-truth dataset of\npitchers who transitioned from relief to starting roles. Our method flags\nmeaningful changes in 91% of these `ground-truth' cases and reveals that, for\nsome metrics, more than 60% of detected changes occur in-season.

This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates.

This fluctuation disrupts reliable acquisition and may result in\ndistortion or clipping. Modulo sampling is now a promising solution to this\nproblem, by folding signals instead of saturating them.

In\nthis work, we propose a method based on a graph neural network, referred to as\nGraphUnwrapNet, for the modulo recovery of EEG signals. Our core idea is to\nrepresent an EEG signal as an organized graph whose channels and temporal\nconnections establish underlying interdependence. One of our key contributions\nis in introducing a pre-estimation guided feature injection module to provide\ncoarse folding indicators that enhance stability during recovery at wrap\nboundaries. This design integrates structural information with folding priors\ninto an integrated framework. We performed comprehensive experiments on the\nSimultaneous Task EEG Workload (STEW) dataset.

We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing.

If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment."}

While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,\ninterventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of\ninequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset\n(Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3\nexerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow\nenforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from\nPIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as\nlearning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap\nby explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,\nensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize\ninterventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal\neffects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained\noptimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method.

This resolves a question posed\nby Hardt and Roth~\\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state\nof the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in\nthe dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the\nWishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas\nprior private algorithms failed to do so.\n  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under\nGaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian\nmechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We\nconjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including\nplanted problems in graphs.\n  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems.

We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of\nTransformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of\nthe local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must\nhave somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global\nrelationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones.

Actions are equally fundamental in\nthe modeling of stochastic processes, as they trigger discontinuous state\ntransitions and enable the flow of information through large, complex systems.\nIn this paper, we unify the perspectives of stochastic processes and\nreinforcement learning through action- driven processes, and illustrate their\napplication to spiking neural networks. Leveraging ideas from\ncontrol-as-inference, we show that minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween a policy-driven true distribution and a reward-driven model\ndistribution for a suitably defined action-driven process is equivalent to\nmaximum entropy reinforcement learning."}

There are two major\napproaches in policy learning: the empirical welfare maximization (EWM)\napproach and the plug-in approach. The EWM approach is analogous to a\nclassification problem, where one first builds an estimator of the population\nwelfare, which is a functional of policy functions, and then trains a policy by\nmaximizing the estimated welfare. In contrast, the plug-in approach is based on\nregression, where one first estimates the conditional average treatment effect\n(CATE) and then recommends the treatment with the highest estimated outcome.\nThis study bridges the gap between the two approaches by showing that both are\nbased on essentially the same optimization problem. In particular, we prove an\nexact equivalence between EWM and least squares over a reparameterization of\nthe policy class. As a consequence, the two approaches are interchangeable in\nseveral respects and share the same theoretical guarantees under common\nconditions. Leveraging this equivalence, we propose a novel regularization\nmethod for policy learning. Our findings yield a convex and computationally\nefficient training procedure that avoids the NP-hard combinatorial step\ntypically required in EWM."}

We\nstudy a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act\nautonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses\nwhether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the\nagent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to\na corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a\ntwo-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies\nas a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an\nalignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value\nfunction, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits\nitself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG\nframework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific\nform of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game\nmeet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its\nown outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a\ntransparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to\ndefer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the\nenvironment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows\nthat through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal\noversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns\nwhen to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety\nviolations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for\nmaking misaligned models safer after deployment."}

In ATE estimation, the balancing weights and\nthe regression functions of the outcome play important roles, where the\nbalancing weights are referred to as the Riesz representer, bias-correction\nterm, and clever covariates, depending on the context. Riesz regression,\ncovariate balancing, DRE, and the matching estimator are methods for estimating\nthe balancing weights, where Riesz regression is essentially equivalent to DRE\nin the ATE context, the matching estimator is a special case of DRE, and DRE is\nin a dual relationship with covariate balancing. TMLE is a method for\nconstructing regression function estimators such that the leading bias term\nbecomes zero. Nearest Neighbor Matching is equivalent to Least Squares Density\nRatio Estimation and Riesz Regression."}
