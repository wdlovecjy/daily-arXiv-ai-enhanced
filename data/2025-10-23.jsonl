In this paper, new models for tuning of the contrast response\nfunctions (CRFs) are proposed. To this end, luminance contrast-evoked LFP\nresponses recorded in primate primary visual cortex (V1) are first analyzed.\nThen, supersaturating CRFs are distinguished from linear and saturating CRFs by\nusing monotonicity index (MI).

Using Monte Carlo\nsimulations across three representative scenarios and nine simulated large\nlanguage models, we evaluate four optimization methods to address the 3D\nmulti-objective optimization (MOO) problem.

Unlike traditional methods relying on\ncross-validation or BIC, the penalty parameter $\\lambda$ is directly tuned for\nfeature selection and is asymptotically pivotal thanks to taking the square\nroot of Cox's partial likelihood. Substantially improving over both\ncross-validation LASSO and BIC subset selection, our approach has a phase\ntransition on the probability of retrieving all and only the good features,\nlike in compressed sensing. The method can be employed by linear models but\nalso by artificial neural networks."}

Our study centers on how to learn and apply\nvalue envelopes within this context. To this end, we introduce a principled\ntwo-stage framework: the first stage uses offline data to derive upper and\nlower bounds on value functions, while the second incorporates these learned\nbounds into online algorithms. Our method extends prior work by decoupling the\nupper and lower bounds, enabling more flexible and tighter approximations. In\ncontrast to approaches that rely on fixed shaping functions, our envelopes are\ndata-driven and explicitly modeled as random variables, with a filtration\nargument ensuring independence across phases. The analysis establishes\nhigh-probability regret bounds determined by two interpretable quantities,\nthereby providing a formal bridge between offline pre-training and online\nfine-tuning. Empirical results on tabular MDPs demonstrate substantial regret\nreductions compared with both UCBVI and prior methods."}

Current methods for learning and\nevaluating world models diverge from this goal: training and evaluation are\nanchored to next-frame prediction, and success is scored by reward maximization\nin the same environment. We propose WorldTest, a protocol to evaluate\nmodel-learning agents that separates reward-free interaction from a scored test\nphase in a different but related environment. WorldTest is\nopen-ended$\\unicode{x2014}$models should support many different tasks unknown\nahead of time$\\unicode{x2014}$and agnostic to model representation, allowing\ncomparison across approaches. We instantiated WorldTest with AutumnBench, a\nsuite of 43 interactive grid-world environments and 129 tasks across three\nfamilies: masked-frame prediction, planning, and predicting changes to the\ncausal dynamics. We compared 517 human participants and three frontier models\non AutumnBench. We found that humans outperform the models, and scaling compute\nimproves performance only in some environments but not others.
