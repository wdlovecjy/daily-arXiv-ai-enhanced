In this study, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) framework that integrates both visual and motor constraints of\npedestrian and driver agents. Using a real-world dataset from an unsignalised\npedestrian crossing, we evaluate four model variants, one without constraints,\ntwo with either motor or visual constraints, and one with both, across\nbehavioural metrics of interaction realism. Results show that the combined\nmodel with both visual and motor constraints performs best. Motor constraints\nlead to smoother movements that resemble human speed adjustments during\ncrossing interactions. The addition of visual constraints introduces perceptual\nuncertainty and field-of-view limitations, leading the agents to exhibit more\ncautious and variable behaviour, such as less abrupt deceleration. In this\ndata-limited setting, our model outperforms a supervised behavioural cloning\nmodel, demonstrating that our approach can be effective without large training\ndatasets. Finally, our framework accounts for individual differences by\nmodelling parameters controlling the human constraints as population-level\ndistributions, a perspective that has not been explored in previous work on\npedestrian-vehicle interaction modelling.

By collapsing a feature's\nrole into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and\ninteractions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis\n(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned\nfunction. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying\nits: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.\nCrucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which\ntracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This\ntemporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it\nlearns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical\nlearning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before\ncomplex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,\npractical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and\npredicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential\ngeometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification\nto a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process."}

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness\ndirectly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and\nsignificant performance degradation."}

However, longitudinal data from routine monitoring is often\ninfrequently and irregularly sampled, and subject to inaccuracies. Due to this,\nmeasurements are often studied in isolation, or simple relationships (e.g.,\nlinear) are used to impute missing timepoints. In this study, we investigated\nthe potential role of Gaussian Processes (GP) modelling to make\npopulation-based and individual predictions, using insulin-like growth factor 1\n(IGF-1) measurements as a test case. With training data of 23 patients with a\nmedian (range) of 4 (1-16) timepoints we identified a trend within the range of\nliterature reported values. In addition, with 8 test cases, individual\npredictions were made with an average root mean squared error of 31.9 (10.1 -\n62.3) ng/ml and 27.4 (0.02 - 66.1) ng/ml for two approaches.

In domains\nwith spatial or relational structure, causal masking is often viewed as\ninappropriate, and sequential linearizations are instead used. Yet the question\nof whether it is viable to accept the information loss introduced by causal\nmasking on nonsequential data has received little direct study, in part because\nfew domains offer both spatial and sequential representations of the same\ndataset. In this work, we investigate this issue in the domain of chess, which\nnaturally supports both representations. We train language models with\nbidirectional and causal self-attention mechanisms on both spatial\n(board-based) and sequential (move-based) data. Our results show that models\ntrained on spatial board states - \\textit{even with causal masking} -\nconsistently achieve stronger playing strength than models trained on\nsequential data. While our experiments are conducted on chess, our results are\nmethodological and may have broader implications: applying causal masking to\nspatial data is a viable procedure for training unimodal LLMs on spatial data,\nand in some domains is even preferable to sequentialization."}

Users may\nprefer to allocate different amounts of reasoning effort depending on how they\nvalue output quality versus latency and cost. To leverage this tradeoff\neffectively, users need fine-grained control over the amount of thinking used\nfor a particular query, but few approaches enable such control. Existing\nmethods require users to specify the absolute number of desired tokens, but\nthis requires knowing the difficulty of the problem beforehand to appropriately\nset the token budget for a query. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive\nEffort Control, a self-adaptive reinforcement learning method that trains\nmodels to use a user-specified fraction of tokens relative to the current\naverage chain-of-thought length for each query. This approach eliminates\ndataset- and phase-specific tuning while producing better cost-accuracy\ntradeoff curves compared to standard methods. Users can dynamically adjust the\ncost-accuracy trade-off through a continuous effort parameter specified at\ninference time. We observe that the model automatically learns to allocate\nresources proportionally to the task difficulty and, across model scales\nranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, our approach enables approximately 3x\nreduction in chain-of-thought length while maintaining or improving performance\nrelative to the base model used for RL training."}

This study focuses on enhancing methods for mapping aboveground\nbiomass in tropical dry forests. Tropical dry forests are considered one of the\nleast understood tropical forest environments; therefore, there is a need for\naccurate approaches to estimate carbon pools. We employ a comparative analysis\nof AGB estimates, utilizing different discrete and full-waveform laser scanning\ndatasets in conjunction with Ordinary Least Squares and Bayesian approaches\nSVM. Airborne Laser Scanning, Unmanned Laser Scanning, and Space Laser Scanning\nwere used as independent variables for extracting forest metrics. Variable\nselection, SVM regression tuning, and cross-validation via a machine-learning\napproach were applied to account for overfitting and underfitting. The results\nindicate that six key variables primarily related to tree height: Elev.minimum,\nElev.L3, lev.MAD.mode, Elev.mode, Elev.MAD.median, and Elev.skewness, are\nimportant for AGB estimation using ALSD and ULSD , while Leaf Area Index,\ncanopy coverage and height, terrain elevation, and full-waveform signal energy\nemerged as the most vital variables.

Such a process is referred\nto as a model-free process. A recurrent neural network (RNN) provides\nparameters of a Gaussian prior that characterize the state of the model-free\nprocess, using all previous measurements at a given time point. In the case of\nDANSE, the measurement system was linear, leading to a closed-form solution for\nthe state posterior. However, the presence of a nonlinear measurement system\nrenders a closed-form solution infeasible. Instead, the second-order statistics\nof the state posterior are computed using the nonlinear measurements observed\nat the time point. We address the nonlinear measurements using a\nreparameterization trick-based particle sampling approach, and estimate the\nsecond-order statistics of the state posterior. The proposed method is referred\nto as particle-based DANSE (pDANSE). The RNN of pDANSE uses sequential\nmeasurements efficiently and avoids the use of computationally intensive\nsequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) and/or ancestral sampling. We describe the\nsemi-supervised learning method for pDANSE, which transitions to unsupervised\nlearning in the absence of labeled data. Using a stochastic Lorenz-$63$ system\nas a benchmark process, we experimentally demonstrate the state estimation\nperformance for four nonlinear measurement systems. We explore cubic\nnonlinearity and a camera-model nonlinearity where unsupervised learning is\nused; then we explore half-wave rectification nonlinearity and\nCartesian-to-spherical nonlinearity where semi-supervised learning is used. The\nperformance of state estimation is shown to be competitive vis-\\`a-vis particle\nfilters that have complete knowledge of the STM of the Lorenz-$63$ system."}
