Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity.

To accurately capture trends in cause-specific mortality,\nit is critical to consider dependencies between causes of death and produce\nforecasts by age and cause coherent with aggregate mortality forecasts. One way\nto achieve these aims is to model cause-specific deaths using compositional\ndata analysis (CODA), treating the density of deaths by age and cause as a set\nof dependent, non-negative values that sum to one. A major drawback of standard\nCODA methods is the challenge of zero values, which frequently occur in\ncause-of-death mortality modelling.

However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

While recent works\nhave explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the\nprediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear\nwhat are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever\nmodifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still\ncompetitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In\nthis work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential\nbasis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made\nat irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based\npredictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state\nrepresentation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular\nobservations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)\nobservation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state\nusing learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous\ntime. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on\nnext-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can\nindeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

While effective in\nmany settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are\ngiven, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address\nthis issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling\nthe specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions.

While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML\nsystems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be\ncritical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal\nwith this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability\ndistribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this\ndeviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance\ncan be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's\nperformance.

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test.

The dataset comes from a\ngovernment survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature\nlearning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were\nextracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily\ninterpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models\n(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular\ndata into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful\ncounterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It\nwas found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the\nbiomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also\nconducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection\ntechniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary\ndeterminants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that\nhealth condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study\ndemonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly\ncontribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human\nbehavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals\nworking to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being."}

While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML\nsystems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be\ncritical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal\nwith this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability\ndistribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this\ndeviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance\ncan be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's\nperformance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable\nstatistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More\nspecifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about\n50\\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement\nLearning agent which is quite significant.

The ideal goal is Retrain\nEquivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the\nretained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data\nbatches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each\nstage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM\nfine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory\nand experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a\nfundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the\noutcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the\nforget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is\ninfluenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it\nimpossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain\nEquivalence.

While prior research has\nattempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login\nattempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password\ncreation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing\nmechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we\npropose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing\nrisks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --\ndefined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and\nrepresent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),\nwe perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between\nsites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by\nincorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as\nnodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a\nfederated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user\nsensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset\nof 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that\nPassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting.

Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale\natmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which\nexhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to\nobtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)\ndemonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve\nensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but\nthis method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency\nadequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex\nrelationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while\nmaintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer\npromising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study\nevaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification\nmechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models\ndistribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space\nsampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models\nare trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts\nto regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that\nprobabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty\nrepresentations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic\nmodel offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,\ndeterministic skill, and physical consistency.

In such an environment, the model should be\nable to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after\nthey are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model\nDeployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human\nengineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other\nknowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an\nunfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection\nof novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution\n(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new\nclasses are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in\ntraditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised\nlearning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and\nincrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the\npast data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered\nclasses, as this would be resource- and time-consuming.

In this work, we present the\nModality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint\nfusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in\nmodality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively\nbalance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during\ntraining to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal\nmodel, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal\npredictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion\ntasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our\nresults show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion\nmethods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during\ntraining.

However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent\npreferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little\nlong-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.\nFocusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for\nsuch users to align the algorithm with their true interests?\n  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split\nbetween a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive\nsystem 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a\nmulti-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,\nspecifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the\nalgorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of\nalignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively\nsteer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are\nsufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are\ninstead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be\nlong, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal\n(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework\nexplains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven\nalgorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both\nthe challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment."}

Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming\nlanguage (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are\nencoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative\nmemory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the\nLisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the\nembedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types\nof nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are\ntherefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,\n1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or\nprogram of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may\ntherefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a\nform of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill\nacquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),\nexceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;\nJones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling\nhuman mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and\nthose representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned."}

This was exemplified by the landmark achievement of\nAlphaFold (Jumper et al. (2021)). In this paper, we study how ML predictions\ncan be safely used in statistical analysis of data towards scientific\ndiscovery. In particular, we follow the framework introduced by Angelopoulos et\nal. (2023). In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$\ngold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and\na ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points.\nWe introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented\nResidual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both\nestimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and\nPPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024),\nrespectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy\ncriterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate\nhow to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms\nexisting methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census\nreports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence,\nwhich is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine\nlearning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of\nPART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of\nPART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions\nin the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1}\n+ n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing\nmethods."}

Specifically, when the target measure $\\pi$ is a mixture $\\pi = w P_0\n+ (1 - w) P_1$, the MFVI optimizer tends to place most of its mass near a\nsingle component of the mixture. This work provides the first theoretical\nexplanation of mode collapse in MFVI.
