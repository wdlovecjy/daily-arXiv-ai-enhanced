Abstract: We present an RL-central framework for Language and Vision Assistants (RLLaVA) with its formulation of Markov decision process (MDP). RLLaVA decouples RL algorithmic logic from model architecture and distributed execution, supporting researchers in implementing new RL algorithms with minimal code, and to plug in a broad family of RL methods and vision-language models (VLMs) while remaining agnostic to specific training and inference engines. RLLaVA makes resource-efficient training of 1B--7B models feasible on common GPUs; notably, 4B-scale models can be trained end-to-end with full-parameter updates on a single 24GB GPU. Experiments on multi-modal and agentic tasks demonstrate that RLLaVA has task extensibility, and the models trained with it consistently improve performance over base models, competitive with other specially engineered RL frameworks. The code is available at https://github.com/TinyLoopX/RLLaVA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Substance overdose mortality in the United States claimed over 80,000 lives in 2023, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing trends through healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes. Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Abstract: Accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is critical for accelerating novel drug development. However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes. In summary, AVP-Fusion serves as a robust and interpretable tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.

Abstract: Humans can efficiently extract knowledge and learn skills from the videos within only a few trials and errors. However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.
  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: This study presents a data-driven, multi-objective approach to predict the mechanical performance, flow ability, and porosity of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC). Out of 21 machine learning algorithms tested, five high-performing models are selected, with XGBoost showing the best accuracy after hyperparameter tuning using Random Search and K-Fold Cross-Validation. The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation services such as navigation and ride-hailing. In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.
  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Agentic language model (LM) systems power modern applications like "Deep Research" and "Claude Code," and leverage multi-LM architectures to overcome context limitations. Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

Abstract: The problem of explaining the results produced by machine learning methods continues to attract attention. Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy. This study addresses the related issues of pseudo-correlation, causality, and combinatorial reasons for tabular data in NN predictors. We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

Abstract: The problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) has been extensively studied. Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.

Abstract: Robustness in complex systems is of significant engineering and economic importance. However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing framework that enhances coarray-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the behavior of solving Life-and-Death (L&D) problems in the game of Go using current state-of-the-art computer Go solvers with two techniques: the Relevance-Zone Based Search (RZS) and the relevance-zone pattern table. We examined the solutions derived by relevance-zone based solvers on seven L&D problems from the renowned book "Life and Death Dictionary" written by Cho Chikun, a Go grandmaster, and found several interesting results. First, for each problem, the solvers identify a relevance-zone that highlights the critical areas for solving. Second, the solvers discover a series of patterns, including some that are rare. Finally, the solvers even find different answers compared to the given solutions for two problems. We also identified two issues with the solver: (a) it misjudges values of rare patterns, and (b) it tends to prioritize living directly rather than maximizing territory, which differs from the behavior of human Go players. We suggest possible approaches to address these issues in future work. Our code and data are available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/study-LD-RZ.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Trisecting agents, issues, and agent pairs are essential topics of three-way conflict analysis. They have been commonly studied based on either a rating or an auxiliary function. A rating function defines the positive, negative, or neutral ratings of agents on issues. An auxiliary function defines the alliance, conflict, and neutrality relations between agents. These functions measure two opposite aspects in a single function, leading to challenges in interpreting their aggregations over a group of issues or agents. For example, when studying agent relations regarding a set of issues, a standard aggregation takes the average of an auxiliary function concerning single issues. Therefore, a pair of alliance +1 and conflict -1 relations will produce the same result as a pair of neutrality 0 relations, although the attitudes represented by the two pairs are very different. To clarify semantics, we separate the two opposite aspects in an auxiliary function into a pair of alliance and conflict functions. Accordingly, we trisect the agents, issues, and agent pairs and investigate their applications in solving a few crucial questions in conflict analysis. Particularly, we explore the concepts of alliance sets and strategies. A real-world application is given to illustrate the proposed models.

Abstract: Most existing work on three-way conflict analysis has focused on trisecting agent pairs, agents, or issues, which contributes to understanding the nature of conflicts but falls short in addressing their resolution. Specifically, the formulation of feasible strategies, as an essential component of conflict resolution and mitigation, has received insufficient scholarly attention. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate feasible strategies from two perspectives of consistency and non-consistency. Particularly, we begin with computing the overall rating of a clique of agents based on positive and negative similarity degrees. Afterwards, considering the weights of both agents and issues, we propose weighted consistency and non-consistency measures, which are respectively used to identify the feasible strategies for a clique of agents. Algorithms are developed to identify feasible strategies, $L$-order feasible strategies, and the corresponding optimal ones. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality, effectiveness, and superiority of the proposed models, we apply them to two commonly used case studies on NBA labor negotiations and development plans for Gansu Province and conduct a sensitivity analysis on parameters and a comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art conflict analysis approaches. The comparison results demonstrate that our conflict resolution models outperform the conventional approaches by unifying weighted agent-issue evaluation with consistency and non-consistency measures to enable the systematic identification of not only feasible strategies but also optimal solutions.

Through our strategic partnership with NVIDIA, we leveraged the NeMo Framework for LLM model fine-tuning to enhance agent performance. Specifically, we optimized the Search and Discovery agent by replacing our base model with a fine-tuned Nemotron small language model (SLM).
  We conducted comprehensive experiments using the llama3.1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 architecture, training LoRA-based models through systematic hyperparameter sweeps across learning rates, optimizers (Adam, AdamW), cosine annealing schedules, and LoRA ranks. Our contributions include: (1) the first application of NVIDIA's NeMo Framework to commerce-specific agent optimization, (2) LLM powered fine-tuning strategy for retrieval-focused commerce tasks, (3) demonstration of significant improvements in latency and cost while maintaining agent quality, and (4) a scalable framework for multi-agent system optimization in production e-commerce environments. Our results demonstrate that the fine-tuned Nemotron SLM effectively resolves the key performance issue in the retrieval component, which represents over 50\% of total agent response time, while maintaining or enhancing overall system performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a variant of multiple-play stochastic bandits tailored to resource allocation problems arising from LLM applications, edge intelligence, etc. The model is composed of $M$ arms and $K$ plays. Each arm has a stochastic number of capacities, and each unit of capacity is associated with a reward function. Each play is associated with a priority weight. When multiple plays compete for the arm capacity, the arm capacity is allocated in a larger priority weight first manner. Instance independent and instance dependent regret lower bounds of $Ω( α_1 σ\sqrt{KM T} )$ and $Ω(α_1 σ^2 \frac{M}Δ \ln T)$ are proved, where $α_1$ is the largest priority weight and $σ$ characterizes the reward tail. When model parameters are given, we design an algorithm named \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} to locate the optimal play allocation policy with a computational complexity of $O(MK^3)$. Utilizing \texttt{MSB-PRS-OffOpt} as a subroutine, an approximate upper confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm is designed, which has instance independent and instance dependent regret upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bound up to factors of $ \sqrt{K \ln KT }$ and $α_1 K^2$ respectively. To this end, we address nontrivial technical challenges arising from optimizing and learning under a special nonlinear combinatorial utility function induced by the prioritized resource sharing mechanism.

Abstract: There has been unprecedented interest in developing agents that expand the boundary of scientific discovery, primarily by optimizing quantitative objective functions specified by scientists. However, for grand challenges in science , these objectives are only imperfect proxies. We argue that automating objective function design is a central, yet unmet requirement for scientific discovery agents. In this work, we introduce the Scientific Autonomous Goal-evolving Agent (SAGA) to amend this challenge. SAGA employs a bi-level architecture in which an outer loop of LLM agents analyzes optimization outcomes, proposes new objectives, and converts them into computable scoring functions, while an inner loop performs solution optimization under the current objectives. This bi-level design enables systematic exploration of the space of objectives and their trade-offs, rather than treating them as fixed inputs. We demonstrate the framework through a broad spectrum of applications, including antibiotic design, inorganic materials design, functional DNA sequence design, and chemical process design, showing that automating objective formulation can substantially improve the effectiveness of scientific discovery agents.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.

Abstract: Being infinite dimensional, non-parametric information geometry has long faced an "intractability barrier" due to the fact that the Fisher-Rao metric is now a functional incurring difficulties in defining its inverse. This paper introduces a novel framework to resolve the intractability with an Orthogonal Decomposition of the Tangent Space ($T_fM=S \oplus S^{\perp}$), where S represents an observable covariate subspace. Through the decomposition, we derive the Covariate Fisher Information Matrix (cFIM), denoted as $G_f$, which is a finite-dimensional and computable representative of information extractable from the manifold's geometry. Indeed, by proving the Trace Theorem: $H_G(f)=\text{Tr}(G_f)$, we establish a rigorous foundation for the G-entropy previously introduced by us, thereby identifying it not merely as a gradient-based regularizer, but also as a fundamental geometric invariant representing the total explainable statistical information captured by the probability distribution associated with the model. Furthermore, we establish a link between $G_f$ and the second-order derivative (i.e. the curvature) of the KL-divergence, leading to the notion of Covariate Cramér-Rao Lower Bound(CRLB). We demonstrate that $G_f$ is congruent to the Efficient Fisher Information Matrix, thereby providing fundamental limits of variance for semi-parametric estimators. Finally, we apply our geometric framework to the Manifold Hypothesis, lifting the latter from a heuristic assumption into a testable condition of rank-deficiency within the cFIM. By defining the Information Capture Ratio, we provide a rigorous method for estimating intrinsic dimensionality in high-dimensional data. In short, our work bridges the gap between abstract information geometry and the demand of explainable AI, by providing a tractable path for revealing the statistical coverage and the efficiency of non-parametric models.

Abstract: Forecasting conflict-related fatalities remains a central challenge in political science and policy analysis due to the sparse, bursty, and highly non-stationary nature of violence data. We introduce DynAttn, an interpretable dynamic-attention forecasting framework for high-dimensional spatio-temporal count processes. DynAttn combines rolling-window estimation, shared elastic-net feature gating, a compact weight-tied self-attention encoder, and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) likelihood. This architecture produces calibrated multi-horizon forecasts of expected casualties and exceedance probabilities, while retaining transparent diagnostics through feature gates, ablation analysis, and elasticity measures.
  We evaluate DynAttn using global country-level and high-resolution PRIO-grid-level conflict data from the VIEWS forecasting system, benchmarking it against established statistical and machine-learning approaches, including DynENet, LSTM, Prophet, PatchTST, and the official VIEWS baseline. Across forecast horizons from one to twelve months, DynAttn consistently achieves substantially higher predictive accuracy, with particularly large gains in sparse grid-level settings where competing models often become unstable or degrade sharply.
  Beyond predictive performance, DynAttn enables structured interpretation of regional conflict dynamics. In our application, cross-regional analyses show that short-run conflict persistence and spatial diffusion form the core predictive backbone, while climate stress acts either as a conditional amplifier or a primary driver depending on the conflict theater.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The prior works on near-field target localization have mostly assumed ideal hardware models and thus suffer from two limitations in practice. First, extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) usually face a variety of hardware impairments (HIs) that may introduce unknown phase and/or amplitude errors. Second, the existing block coordinate descent (BCD)-based methods for joint estimation of the HI indicator, channel gain, angle, and range may induce considerable target localization error when the target is very close to the XL-array. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a new three-phase HI-aware near-field localization method, by efficiently detecting faulty antennas and estimating the positions of targets. Specifically, we first determine faulty antennas by using compressed sensing (CS) methods and improve detection accuracy based on coarse target localization. Then, a dedicated phase calibration method is designed to correct phase errors induced by detected faulty antennas. Subsequently, an efficient near-field localization method is devised to accurately estimate the positions of targets based on the full XL-array with phase calibration. Additionally, we resort to the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) to quantify the performance loss caused by HIs. Last, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly reduces the localization errors as compared to various benchmark schemes, especially for the case with a short target range and/or a high fault probability.

Abstract: The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) into 6G systems is crucial for achieving seamless global coverage, particularly in underserved and disaster-prone regions. Among NTN platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are especially promising due to their rapid deployability. However, this shift from fixed, wired base stations (BSs) to mobile, wireless, energy-constrained UAV-BSs introduces unique security challenges. Their central role in emergency communications makes them attractive candidates for emergency alert spoofing. Their limited computing and energy resources make them more vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and their dependence on wireless backhaul links and GNSS navigation exposes them to jamming, interception, and spoofing. Furthermore, UAV mobility opens new attack vectors such as malicious handover manipulation. This paper identifies several attack surfaces of UAV-BS systems and outlines principles for mitigating their threats.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to provide burgeoning imaging services for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs), thereby enabling large-scale environmental sensing and timely situational awareness. Conventional SAR systems typically leverages a deterministic radar waveform, while it conflicts with the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigm by discarding signaling randomness, in whole or in part. In fact, this approach reduces to the uplink pilot sensing in 5G New Radio (NR) with sounding reference signals (SRS), underutilizing data symbols. To explore the potential of data-aided imaging, we develop a low-altitude SAR imaging framework that sufficiently leverages data symbols carried by the native orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communication waveform. The randomness of modulated data in the temporal-frequency (TF) domain, introduced by non-constant modulus constellations such as quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), may however severely degrade the imaging quality. To mitigate this effect, we incorporate several TF-domain filtering schemes within a rangeDoppler (RD) imaging framework and evaluate their impact. We further propose using the normalized mean square error (NMSE) of a reference point target's profile as an imaging performance metric. Simulation results with 5G NR parameters demonstrate that data-aided imaging substantially outperforms pilot-only counterpart, accordingly validating the effectiveness of the proposed OFDM-SAR imaging approach in LAWNs.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a vital component in the development of intelligent and adaptive transceivers for future wireless communication systems. Existing statistically-based blind modulation classification methods for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) often fail to achieve the required accuracy and performance. Consequently, the modulation classification research community has shifted its focus toward deep learning techniques, which demonstrate promising performance, but come with increased computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a lightweight subcarrier-based modulation classification method for OFDM systems. In the proposed approach, a selected set of subcarriers in an OFDM frame is classified first, followed by the prediction of the modulation types for the remaining subcarriers based on the initial results. A Lightweight Neural Network (LWNN) is employed to identify the initially selected set of subcarriers, and its output is fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as an embedded vector to predict the modulation schemes of the remaining subcarriers in the OFDM frame.

Abstract: We investigate distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, in which multiple phase-synchronized access points (APs) jointly serve user equipments (UEs) while cooperatively detecting and estimating multiple static targets. To achieve high-accuracy multi-target estimation, we propose a two-stage sensing framework combining non-coherent and coherent maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. In parallel, adaptive AP mode-selection strategies are introduced to balance communication and sensing performance: a communication-centric scheme that maximizes downlink spectral efficiency (SE) and a sensing-centric scheme that selects geometrically diverse receive APs to enhance sensing coverage. Simulation results confirm the SE-sensing trade-off, where appropriate power allocation between communication and sensing and larger array apertures alleviate performance degradation, achieving high SE with millimeter-level sensing precision. We further demonstrate that the proposed AP-selection strategy reveals an optimal number of receive APs that maximizes sensing coverage without significantly sacrificing SE.
