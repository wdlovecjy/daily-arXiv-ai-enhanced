Abstract: We explore hand-gesture recognition through the use of passive body-worn reflective tags. A data processing pipeline is proposed to address the issue of missing data. Specifically, missing information is recovered through linear and exponential interpolation and extrapolation. Furthermore, imputation and proximity-based inference are employed. We represent tags as nodes in a temporal graph, with edges formed based on correlations between received signal strength (RSS) and phase values across successive timestamps, and we train a graph-based convolutional neural network that exploits graph-based self-attention. The system outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 98.13% for the recognition of 21 gestures. We achieve 89.28% accuracy under leave-one-person-out cross-validation. We further investigate the contribution of various body locations on the recognition accuracy. Removing tags from the arms reduces accuracy by more than 10%, while removing the wrist tag only reduces accuracy by around 2%. Therefore, tag placements on the arms are more expressive for gesture recognition than on the wrist.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate hand gesture recognition by leveraging passive reflective tags worn on the body. Considering a large set of gestures, distinct patterns are difficult to be captured by learning algorithms using backscattered received signal strength (RSS) and phase signals. This is because these features often exhibit similarities across signals from different gestures. To address this limitation, we explore the estimation of Angle of Arrival (AoA) as a distinguishing feature, since AoA characteristically varies during body motion. To ensure reliable estimation in our system, which employs Smart Antenna Switching (SAS), we first validate AoA estimation using the Multiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm while the tags are fixed at specific angles. Building on this, we propose an AoA tracking method based on Kalman smoothing. Our analysis demonstrates that, while RSS and phase alone are insufficient for distinguishing certain gesture data, AoA tracking can effectively differentiate them. To evaluate the effectiveness of AoA tracking, we implement gesture recognition system benchmarks and show that incorporating AoA features significantly boosts their performance. Improvements of up to 15% confirm the value of AoA-based enhancement.

Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) identifies the attended speech stream in multi-speaker environments by decoding brain signals such as electroencephalography (EEG). This technology is essential for realizing smart hearing aids that address the cocktail party problem and for facilitating objective audiometry systems. Existing AAD research mainly utilizes dichotic environments where different speech signals are presented to the left and right ears, enabling models to classify directional attention rather than speech content. However, this spatial reliance limits applicability to real-world scenarios, such as the "cocktail party" situation, where speakers overlap or move dynamically. To address this challenge, we propose an AAD framework for diotic environments where identical speech mixtures are presented to both ears, eliminating spatial cues. Our approach maps EEG and speech signals into a shared latent space using independent encoders. We extract speech features using wav2vec 2.0 and encode them with a 2-layer 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), while employing the BrainNetwork architecture for EEG encoding. The model identifies the attended speech by calculating the cosine similarity between EEG and speech representations. We evaluate our method on a diotic EEG dataset and achieve 72.70% accuracy, which is 22.58% higher than the state-of-the-art direction-based AAD method.

Abstract: In this contribution, we propose a GNSS/INS ultra-tight coupling in which the GNSS receiver architecture is based on a vector tracking loop type architecture. In the proposed approach, the phase lock loop bandwidth is adapted according to the inertial navigation system information. The latter has the advantage to be easily implementable on a System-on-Chip component such as an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), and can be implemented with minor modifications on an existing GNSS receiver platform. Moreover, compared to classical vector-based solutions, the proposed architecture decodes the navigation message in the loop, without the need to run scalar loops in parallel or having to store pre-downloaded ephemeris data. This architecture therefore does not increase the area occupied on the FPGA and does not use additional resources for storage. The proposed GNSS receiver architecture uses GPS L1/C and Galileo E1 signals and is composed of one acquisition module and 16 tracking channels (8 GPS and 8 Galileo) which are implemented within a FPGA (Zynq-Ultrascale).

Abstract: The fundamental frequency is one of the parameters that define power quality. Correctly determining this parameter under the conditions that prevail in modern power grids is crucial. Diagnostic purposes often require an efficient estimation of this parameter within short time windows. Therefore, this article presents the results of numerical simulation studies that allow the assessment of errors in various fundamental frequency estimation methods, including the standard IEC 61000-4-30 method, when the analyzed signal has a form similar to that found in modern power grids. For the purposes of this study, a test signal was adopted recreating the states of the power grid, including the simultaneous occurrence of voltage fluctuations and distortions. Conclusions are presented based on conducted research.

Abstract: We design a gesture-recognition pipeline for networks of distributed, resource constrained devices utilising Einsum Networks. Einsum Networks are probabilistic circuits that feature a tractable inference, explainability, and energy efficiency. The system is validated in a scenario of low-power, body-worn, passive Radio Frequency Identification-based gesture recognition. Each constrained device includes task-specific processing units responsible for Received Signal Strength (RSS) and phase processing or Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation, along with feature extraction, as well as dedicated Einsum hardware that processes the extracted features. The output of all constrained devices is then fused in a decision aggregation module to predict gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms the benchmark models.

Abstract: The letter introduces and studies the problem of defining the minimum number of Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) elements needed to compensate for heavy fading conditions in multipath fading channels. The fading severity is quantified in terms of Hyper-Rayleigh Regimes (HRRs) (i.e., full-HRR (worst-case conditions), strong-, weak-, and no-HRR), and the channel model used (Inverse Power Lomax (IPL)) was chosen since it can account for all HRRs. The research presents the derived closed-form channel coefficient envelope statistics for the single IRS-element channel with IPL statistics in both subchannels and total IRS-assisted channel, as well as tight approximations for the channel coefficient and instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) statistics for the latter. The derived expressions helped estimate channel parameters corresponding to the specific HRRs of the total channel and demonstrate that while both single links (i.e., ''source-IRS'' and ''IRS-destination'') are in full-HRR, the minimum number of IRS elements needed to bring the total IRS-assisted link (''source-IRS-destination'') out of full-HRR is no less than $6$ (for the whole range on the IPL scale parameter corresponding full-HRR). Furthermore, the minimum number of IRS elements required to bring the total IRS-assisted link into no-HRR is $14$ (under the same conditions).

Abstract: College students experience many stressors, resulting in high levels of anxiety and depression. Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments.

Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.

Abstract: Rare-event prediction is critical in domains such as healthcare, finance, reliability engineering, customer support, aviation safety, where positive outcomes are infrequent yet potentially catastrophic. Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.

Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.

Abstract: Designing experiments that systematically gather data from complex physical systems is central to accelerating scientific discovery. While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study multigrade deep learning (MGDL) as a principled framework for structured error refinement in deep neural networks. While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks. Numerical experiments further illustrate the theoretical results.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The study on the expressive power of transformers shows that transformers are permutation equivariant, and they can approximate all permutation-equivariant continuous functions on a compact domain. However, these results are derived under real parameters and exact operations, while real implementations on computers can only use a finite set of numbers and inexact machine operations with round-off errors. In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness refers to a model's ability to resist perturbation of inputs, while distribution robustness evaluates the performance of the model under data shifts. Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\ell_\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data set composed of categorical features is very common in big data analysis tasks. Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across decentralized subgraphs without exposing raw data. While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.

Abstract: The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training on graph data across multiple clients. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.

Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.

Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms. The code is avalible at https://github.com/IQuestLab/UBio-MolFM/tree/e2formerv2.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships is critical for healthcare. Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

Abstract: In many learning tasks, certain requirements on the processing of individual data samples should arguably be formalized as strict constraints in the underlying optimization problem, rather than by means of arbitrary penalties. We show that, in these scenarios, learning can be carried out exploiting a sequential penalty method that allows to properly deal with constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning scenarios. Moreover, the results of experiments on image processing tasks show that the method is indeed viable to be used in practice.

Abstract: Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.

Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.

Abstract: While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.
  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.
  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.

Abstract: In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.

Abstract: Exact recovery in stochastic block models (SBMs) is well understood in undirected settings, but remains considerably less developed for directed and sparse networks, particularly when the number of communities diverges. Spectral methods for directed SBMs often lack stability in asymmetric, low-degree regimes, and existing non-spectral approaches focus primarily on undirected or dense settings.
  We propose a fully non-spectral, two-stage procedure for community detection in sparse directed SBMs with potentially growing numbers of communities. The method first estimates the directed probability matrix using a neighborhood-smoothing scheme tailored to the asymmetric setting, and then applies $K$-means clustering to the estimated rows, thereby avoiding the limitations of eigen- or singular value decompositions in sparse, asymmetric networks. Our main theoretical contribution is a uniform row-wise concentration bound for the smoothed estimator, obtained through new arguments that control asymmetric neighborhoods and separate in- and out-degree effects. These results imply the exact recovery of all community labels with probability tending to one, under mild sparsity and separation conditions that allow both $γ_n \to 0$ and $K_n \to \infty$.
  Simulation studies, including highly directed, sparse, and non-symmetric block structures, demonstrate that the proposed procedure performs reliably in regimes where directed spectral and score-based methods deteriorate. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first exact recovery guarantee for this class of non-spectral, neighborhood-smoothing methods in the sparse, directed setting.

Abstract: Recent developments in financial time series focus on modeling volatility across multiple assets or indices in a multivariate framework, accounting for potential interactions such as spillover effects. Furthermore, the increasing integration of global financial markets provides a similar dynamics (referred to as comovement). In this context, we introduce a novel model for volatility vectors within the Multiplicative Error Model (MEM) class. This framework accommodates both spillover and co-movement effects through a distinct latent component. By adopting a specific parameterization, the model remains computationally feasible even for high-dimensional volatility vectors. To reduce the number of unknown coefficients, we propose a simple model-based clustering procedure. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through an empirical application to 29 assets of the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, providing insight into volatility spillovers and shared market dynamics. Comparative analysis against alternative vector MEMs, including a fully parameterized version of the proposed model, demonstrates its superior or at least comparable performance across multiple evaluation criteria.

Abstract: Extreme heat is an escalating public health concern. Although prior studies have examined heat-health associations, their reliance on restricted diagnoses and diagnostic categories misses or misclassifies heat-related illness. We conducted a heat-wide association study to identify acute-care diagnoses associated with extreme heat in Chicago, Illinois. Using 916,904 acute-care visits -- including emergency department and urgent care encounters -- among 372,140 adults across five healthcare systems from 2011-2023, we applied a two-stage analytic approach: quasi-Poisson regression to screen 1,803 diagnosis codes for heat-related risks, followed by distributed lag non-linear models in a time-stratified case-crossover design to refine the list of heat-related diagnoses and estimate same-day and short-term cumulative odds ratios of acute-care visits during extreme heat versus reference temperature. We observed same-day increases in visits for heat illness, volume depletion, hypotension, edema, acute kidney failure, and multiple injuries. By analyzing the full diagnostic spectrum of acute-care services, this study comprehensively characterizes heat-associated morbidity, reinforcing and advancing existing literature.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.
