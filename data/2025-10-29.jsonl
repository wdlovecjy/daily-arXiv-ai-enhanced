Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of\nmissing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications\nwhere the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to\nbe monitored, due to budget constraints.

However, these\nmodels often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with\nlow confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to\nenhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering\nlow-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance\nHardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining\nthe dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism\nduring inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We\nevaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating\nits effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive\nperformance and rejection rate.

Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in\nuncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is\nthat GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often\nrely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors,\nsuch that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified\nGP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters\nfrom the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on\nthe network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the\nscalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way."}

Traditional\nfairness methods typically impose constraints at the prediction level, without\naddressing underlying biases in data representations. In this work, we propose\na principled framework that adjusts data representations to balance predictive\nutility and fairness. Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the\nfeature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and\ncontrol the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive\ninformation. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and\nfairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence\nfunctions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter\nestimates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our\ntheoretical insights and show that the proposed method effectively improves\nfairness while preserving predictive performance."}

We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)\nproblem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a\nsingle processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We\ndevelop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger\n(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date\n(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that\nemployed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered\nalgorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time\nderived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare\ntheir performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across\nvarious job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than\n100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become\ncomputationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD\nrule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently\noutperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact\napproaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows\nthat human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics\nfor NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited\nresources when effectively configured."}

Our approach\nseparates encoder outputs into shared and private embeddings. We align shared\nembeddings across modalities and fuse them into a modality-invariant\nrepresentation.

Using a real world dataset of an EV\nfollowing an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving\nconditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE\nbetween predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts\nacceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate\nthe Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),\n0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,\nCACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings\nhighlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios.
