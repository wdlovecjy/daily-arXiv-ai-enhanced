For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -\u03a3 p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials).

To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives.

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems.

Yet when fairness constraints such as demographic parity are introduced, their effects on model coefficients, and thus on how predictive bias is distributed across features, remain opaque. Existing approaches on linear models often rely on strong and unrealistic assumptions, or overlook the explicit role of the sensitive attribute, limiting their practical utility for fairness assessment. We extend the work of (Chzhen and Schreuder, 2022) and (Fukuchi and Sakuma, 2023) by proposing a post-processing framework that can be applied on top of any linear model to decompose the resulting bias into direct (sensitive-attribute) and indirect (correlated-features) components. Our method analytically characterizes how demographic parity reshapes each model coefficient, including those of both sensitive and non-sensitive features.

Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods.

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\\times$ runtime speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PAZO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DP-SGD\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96f6\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5982DP-SGD\uff0c\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPAZO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u8f85\u52a9\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "PAZO\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9690\u79c1/\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe16\u500d\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "PAZO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79c1\u6709\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HyperComplEx\u6df7\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u66f2\u3001\u590d\u6570\u548c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5411\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u7c7b\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ece1K\u8bba\u6587\u523010M\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4TransE\u3001RotatE\u3001DistMult\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u572810M\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.612 MRR\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.8%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c85ms\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperComplEx\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5d4c\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u7c7b(LPC)\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86MIP\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u53ef\u5206\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b\u800cMIP\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4f46\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u7279\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff1b2. \u5c06LPC\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u4f18\u5316(QPBO)\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3. \u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eMIP\u516c\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709MIP\u516c\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LPC\u5168\u5c40\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8425\u9500\u3001\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8fde\u7eed\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3Densest k-Subgraph\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u539f\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u9002\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u60e9\u7f5a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e0e\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u975e\u51f8\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "DkS\u95ee\u9898\u662fNP\u96be\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8fde\u7eed\u60e9\u7f5a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u539f\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u60e9\u7f5a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u51f8\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u975e\u51f8\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u4ee5\u95ed\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DkS\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53Dk1k2BS\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u60e9\u7f5a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u539f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and the baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, which demonstrates that: i) Compared to the conventional MIMO and baseline PASS, the proposed PASS-WPT framework achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE of EHRs, and ii) also increases the sum rate by 77.81% and 31.91% for IDRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u5e76\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u529f\u7387\u8f90\u5c04\u6bd4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5171\u5b58\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u53d1\u5c04\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u529f\u7387\u8f90\u5c04\u6bd4\u53ef\u884c\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u529f\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u4e0b\u5c42\u7ec6\u5316\u529f\u7387\u8f90\u5c04\u6bd4\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u603b\u901f\u7387\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u7528\u6237\u548c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u5206\u522b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u3001WMMSE\u548cQT-LDT\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684PASS-WPT\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfMIMO\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u529f\u7387\u8f90\u5c04\u7684\u57fa\u7ebfPASS\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u529f\u7387\u8f6c\u6362\u6548\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534781.45%\u548c43.19%\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u603b\u901f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534777.81%\u548c31.91%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5939\u6301\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u7ebf\u529f\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u91cf\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Essence\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6253\u7834\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6253\u7834\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4(Akg\u00fcn et al. 2025)\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PI-MJCA-BiGRU\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u751f\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u5173\u8282\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5173\u8282\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757(MJCA)\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143(BiGRU)\u5c42\u6355\u6349\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u8026\u5408\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cPI-MJCA-BiGRU\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0cMJCA\u6a21\u5757\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u529b\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, \"Truth Last\", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks.

For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "EcoAlign\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7406\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6709\u5bb3\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u6027\u7406\u7531\u4f2a\u88c5\u7ed5\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEcoAlign\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u601d\u7ef4\u56fe\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u51c0\u73b0\u503c\uff09\u5bf9\u884c\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u9884\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5269\u4f59\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u539f\u5219\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c2\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u30016\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEcoAlign\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "EcoAlign\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684LVLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CURENet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b14\u8bb0\u3001\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u5904\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5c31\u8bca\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u8d85\u8fc794%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCURENet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u5e8f\u5217\u5c31\u8bca\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001EHR\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cFEMH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u524d10\u79cd\u6162\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc794%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001EHR\u6574\u5408\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization.

Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism.

We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u89c1-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u504f\u5dee\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u4e09\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7814\u7a76\u9012\u5f52\u7ec4\u5408\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u5dee\u7279\u6027\u3002\u5728ETTm1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u8ddd\u6052\u4e3a\u96f6\uff1b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u4e00\u6b65\u65b9\u5dee\u4e58\u4ee5\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9012\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u4e0d\u5e94\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u504f\u89c1-\u65b9\u5dee\u76f4\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training.

First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh.

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion.

Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
