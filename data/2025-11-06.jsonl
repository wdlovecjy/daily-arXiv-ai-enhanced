Large language models show promise for\nindividual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental\nlimitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning\npatterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a\nmulti-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition\ninto specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis,\nand reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent\ncontexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models\nand 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems.\nFirst, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the\nstrongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model\nscale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and\nconditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent\neffectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev\n20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or\nanalysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing\nreport or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits\npersist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94%\ndiscovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning\nenhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96%\nfor analysis) requires model-aware architecture design.

Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a\nframework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner.

By\ncapturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse\nperiods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations.

On\nthis basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal\nevolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations\nare used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving\nthe ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring\nfunctions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified\nmodeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which\nenables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of\npotential anomaly propagation paths.

Existing works\non BO with knowledge transfer either do not have theoretical guarantees or\nachieve the same regret as BO in the non-transfer setting,\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T \\gamma_f})$, where $T$ is the number of\nevaluations of the target function and $\\gamma_f$ denotes its information gain.\nIn this paper, we propose the DeltaBO algorithm, in which a novel\nuncertainty-quantification approach is built on the difference function\n$\\delta$ between the source and target functions, which are allowed to belong\nto different reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Under mild assumptions,\nwe prove that the regret of DeltaBO is of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T\n(T/N + \\gamma_\\delta)})$, where $N$ denotes the number of evaluations from\nsource tasks and typically $N \\gg T$. In many applications, source and target\ntasks are similar, which implies that $\\gamma_\\delta$ can be much smaller than\n$\\gamma_f$. Empirical studies on both real-world hyperparameter tuning tasks\nand synthetic functions show that DeltaBO outperforms other baseline methods\nand support our theoretical claims."}
