Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Targeted maintenance strategies, ensuring the dependability and safety of industrial machinery. However, current modeling techniques for assessing both local and global correlation of battery degradation sequences are inefficient and difficult to meet the needs in real-life applications. For this reason, we propose a novel deep learning architecture, multiscale dual-path feature aggregation network (MDFA-Net), for RUL prediction. MDFA-Net consists of dual-path networks, the first path network, multiscale feature network (MF-Net) that maintains the shallow information and avoids missing information, and the second path network is an encoder network (EC-Net) that captures the continuous trend of the sequences and retains deep details. Integrating both deep and shallow attributes effectively grasps both local and global patterns. Testing conducted with two publicly available Lithium-ion battery datasets reveals our approach surpasses existing top-tier methods in RUL forecasting, accurately mapping the capacity degradation trajectory.

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction. Our experimental setup and source code are available at https://github.com/kuiumdjiev/Per-Axis-Weight-Deltas-for-Frequent-Model-Updates.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.

Abstract: Forecasting technological advancement in complex domains such as space exploration presents significant challenges due to the intricate interaction of technical, economic, and policy-related factors. The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models.
  Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors.
  Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

Abstract: We propose an alternative to sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a simple and effective unsupervised method for extracting interpretable concepts from neural networks. The core idea is to cluster differences in activations, which we formally justify within a discriminant analysis framework. To enhance the diversity of extracted concepts, we refine the approach by weighting the clustering using the skewness of activations. The method aligns with Deleuze's modern view of concepts as differences. We evaluate the approach across five models and three modalities (vision, language, and audio), measuring concept quality, diversity, and consistency. Our results show that the proposed method achieves concept quality surpassing prior unsupervised SAE variants while approaching supervised baselines, and that the extracted concepts enable steering of a model's inner representations, demonstrating their causal influence on downstream behavior.

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been an active area of research, with applications ranging from healthcare to smart environments. The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new possibilities to leverage their capabilities in HAR, enabling not just activity classification but also interpretability and human-like interaction. In this paper, we present a Large Multi-Modal Agent designed for HAR, which integrates the power of LLMs to enhance both performance and user engagement. The proposed framework not only delivers activity classification but also bridges the gap between technical outputs and user-friendly insights through its reasoning and question-answering capabilities. We conduct extensive evaluations using widely adopted HAR datasets, including HHAR, Shoaib, Motionsense to assess the performance of our framework. The results demonstrate that our model achieves high classification accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly improving interpretability through its reasoning and Q&A capabilities.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Abstract: Designing efficient transit route networks is an NP-hard problem with exponentially large solution spaces that traditionally relies on manual planning processes. We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on graph attention networks for sequential transit network construction. To address the long-horizon credit assignment challenge, we introduce a two-level reward structure combining incremental topological feedback with simulation-based terminal rewards. We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Abstract: Optimizing maritime operations, particularly fuel consumption for vessels, is crucial, considering its significant share in global trade. As fuel consumption is closely related to the shaft power of a vessel, predicting shaft power accurately is a crucial problem that requires careful consideration to minimize costs and emissions. Traditional approaches, which incorporate empirical formulas, often struggle to model dynamic conditions, such as sea conditions or fouling on vessels. In this paper, we present a hybrid, physics-guided neural network-based approach that utilizes empirical formulas within the network to combine the advantages of both neural networks and traditional techniques. We evaluate the presented method using data obtained from four similar-sized cargo vessels and compare the results with those of a baseline neural network and a traditional approach that employs empirical formulas. The experimental results demonstrate that the physics-guided neural network approach achieves lower mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error for all tested vessels compared to both the empirical formula-based method and the base neural network.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands. In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark. We analyze various implementation strategies to highlight the versatility and potential of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Abstract: We show that the output of a ReLU neural network can be interpreted as the value of a zero-sum, turn-based, stopping game, which we call the ReLU net game. The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel secure wireless transmission architecture that enables the co-existence of spatial field modulation (SFM) and digital bandpass modulation (DBM), utilizing multi-mode vortex waves and programmable meta-surfaces (PMS). Distinct from conventional joint modulation schemes, our approach establishes two logically independent transmission channels--SFM and DBM--thereby eliminating the need for joint signal design or time synchronization. Specifically, the orthogonality of vortex wave modes is exploited to construct a high-capacity multi-mode DBM channel, in which each mode carries modulated symbols independently. As the composite waveform passes through the PMS, energy from different vortex modes is spatially focused onto distinct positions, dynamically determined by the PMS configuration. This spatial mapping forms a unique lookup table that encodes additional information in the electro-magnetic (EM) field distribution, effectively enabling a second, concurrent SFM channel. To enhance physical-layer security, the DBM channel transmits encrypted symbols transformed via dynamic symbol-domain mapping, while the corresponding mapping relations--or key information--are carried by the SFM channel. This lightweight dual-channel encryption strategy provides strong confidentiality without requiring complex joint decoding. To validate the feasibility of the proposed architecture, we design and implement a proof-of-concept prototype system, and conduct experimental demonstrations under real-world wireless communication conditions. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the co-existent DBM-SFM design in achieving reliable and secure transmission. The proposed architecture offers a scalable, low-complexity, and secure transmission solution for future IoT networks, especially in scenarios demanding both spectral efficiency and physical-layer confidentiality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as key enablers of automation in domains such as telecommunications, assisting with tasks including troubleshooting, standards interpretation, and network optimization. However, their deployment in practice must balance inference cost, latency, and reliability. In this work, we study an edge-cloud-expert cascaded LLM-based knowledge system that supports decision-making through a question-and-answer pipeline. In it, an efficient edge model handles routine queries, a more capable cloud model addresses complex cases, and human experts are involved only when necessary. We define a misalignment-cost constrained optimization problem, aiming to minimize average processing cost, while guaranteeing alignment of automated answers with expert judgments. We propose a statistically rigorous threshold selection method based on multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) for a query processing mechanism based on knowledge and confidence tests. The approach provides finite-sample guarantees on misalignment risk. Experiments on the TeleQnA dataset -- a telecom-specific benchmark -- demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cost-efficiency compared to conventional cascaded baselines, while ensuring reliability at prescribed confidence levels.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been extensively applied in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems due to the capability of enhancing physical layer security (PLS). However, conventional static RIS architectures lack the flexibility required for adaptive beam control in multi-user and multifunctional scenarios. To address this issue without introducing additional hardware complexity and power consumption, in this paper, we exploit a movable RIS (MRIS) architecture, which consists of a large fixed sub-surface and a smaller movable sub-surface that slides on the fixed sub-surface to achieve dynamic beam reconfiguration with static phase shifts. This paper investigates an MRIS-assisted ISAC system under imperfect sensing estimation, where dedicated radar signals serve as artificial noise to enhance secure transmission against potential eavesdroppers (Eves). The transmit beamforming vectors, MRIS phase shifts, and relative positions of the two sub-surfaces are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum secrecy rate, ensuring robust secrecy performance for the weakest user under the uncertainty of the Eves' channels. To handle the non-convexity, a convex bound is derived for the Eve channel uncertainty, and the S-procedure is employed to reformulate semi-infinite constraints as linear matrix inequalities. An efficient alternating optimization and penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MRIS architecture substantially improves secrecy performance, especially when only a small number of elements are allocated to the movable sub-surface.

Abstract: A multiuser uplink transmission framework based on the segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) is proposed under two operating protocols: segment selection (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). For each protocol, the achievable uplink sum-rate is characterized for both time-division multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Low-complexity placement methods for the pinching antennas (PAs) are developed for both protocols and for both multiple-access schemes. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that SWAN achieves higher sum-rate performance than conventional pinching-antenna systems, while SA provides additional performance gains over SS.

Abstract: In many applications of biotechnology, measurements are available at different sampling rates, e.g., due to online sensors and offline lab analysis. Offline measurements typically involve time delays that may be unknown a priori due to the underlying laboratory procedures. This multirate (MR) setting poses a challenge to Kalman filtering, where conventionally measurement data is assumed to be available on an equidistant time grid and without delays. The present study derives the MR version of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based on sample state augmentation, and applies it to the anaerobic digestion (AD) process in a simulative agricultural setting. The performance of the MR-EKF is investigated for various scenarios, i.e., varying delay lengths, measurement noise levels, plant-model mismatch (PMM), and initial state error. Provided with an adequate tuning, the MR-EKF could be demonstrated to reliably estimate the process state, to appropriately fuse delayed offline measurements, and to smooth noisy online measurements well. Because of the sample state augmentation approach, the delay length of offline measurements does not critically impair state estimation performance, provided observability is not lost during the delays. Poor state initialization and PMM affect convergence more than measurement noise levels. Further, selecting an appropriate tuning was found to be critically important for successful application of the MR-EKF, for which a systematic approach is presented. This study provides implementation guidance for practitioners aiming at successfully applying state estimation for multirate systems. It thereby contributes to develop demand-driven operation of biogas plants, which may aid in stabilizing a renewable electricity grid.

Abstract: Collecting operationally realistic data to inform machine learning models can be costly. Before collecting new data, it is helpful to understand where a model is deficient. For example, object detectors trained on images of rare objects may not be good at identification in poorly represented conditions. We offer a way of informing subsequent data acquisition to maximize model performance by leveraging the toolkit of computer experiments and metadata describing the circumstances under which the training data was collected (e.g., season, time of day, location). We do this by evaluating the learner as the training data is varied according to its metadata. A Gaussian process (GP) surrogate fit to that response surface can inform new data acquisitions. This meta-learning approach offers improvements to learner performance as compared to data with randomly selected metadata, which we illustrate on both classic learning examples, and on a motivating application involving the collection of aerial images in search of airplanes.

Abstract: Survival analysis relies fundamentally on the semi-parametric Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) model and the parametric Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model. CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process.

Abstract: The global impetus for extracting rare earth elements (REEs) is shaping the future of green technologies. From high-efficiency magnets in wind turbines to advanced batteries and solar photovoltaics, REEs are indispensable for a greener world through the energy transition. However, supply chains remain a barrier for the majority of the global population. India is mainly dependent on imports for most REEs. Innovation and recycling efforts in most REEs are still in their early stages. For India, aspiring to Viksit Bharat by 2047, securing sustainable REE access is critical to national energy security and technological independence. This paper explores India's opportunities and challenges in the REE domain, high-lighting underutilized resources such as copper tailings, fly ash, and e-waste. We argue for circular economy pathways that can reduce environmental impacts and strengthen domestic supply. Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL), as India's sole vertically integrated copper producer, is uniquely positioned to pioneer co-recovery of REEs, advance research and development partnerships, and build a comprehensive supply chain. By embedding sustainability, ESG principles, and community trust in its strategy, HCL can evolve into a national champion in this domain.

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Abstract: Memory systems have been designed to leverage past experiences in Large Language Model (LLM) agents. However, many deployed memory systems primarily optimize compression and storage, with comparatively less emphasis on explicit, closed-loop control of memory retrieval. From this observation, we build memory retrieval as an autonomous, accurate, and compatible agent system, named MemR$^3$, which has two core mechanisms: 1) a router that selects among retrieve, reflect, and answer actions to optimize answer quality; 2) a global evidence-gap tracker that explicitly renders the answering process transparent and tracks the evidence collection process. This design departs from the standard retrieve-then-answer pipeline by introducing a closed-loop control mechanism that enables autonomous decision-making. Empirical results on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that MemR$^3$ surpasses strong baselines on LLM-as-a-Judge score, and particularly, it improves existing retrievers across four categories with an overall improvement on RAG (+7.29%) and Zep (+1.94%) using GPT-4.1-mini backend, offering a plug-and-play controller for existing memory stores.

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
