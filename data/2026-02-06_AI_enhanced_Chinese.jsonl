However, most data-driven calibrations remain deterministic, producing a single best-fit parameter vector and offering limited guidance for uncertainty-aware prediction, risk-sensitive evaluation, and population-level simulation. Bayesian calibration addresses this gap by inferring a posterior distribution over parameters, but per-trajectory sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are computationally infeasible for modern large-scale naturalistic driving datasets. This paper proposes an active simulation-based inference framework for scalable car-following model calibration. The approach combines (i) a residual-augmented car-following simulator with two alternatives for the residual process and (ii) an amortized conditional density estimator that maps an observed leader--follower trajectory directly to a driver-specific posterior over model parameters with a single forward pass at test time. To reduce simulation cost during training, we introduce a joint active design strategy that selects informative parameter proposals together with representative driving contexts, focusing simulations where the current inference model is most uncertain while maintaining realism. Experiments on the HighD dataset show improved predictive accuracy and closer agreement between simulated and observed trajectory distributions relative to Bayesian calibration baselines, with convergence and ablation studies supporting the robustness of the proposed design choices.

Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained.

We challenge this assumption by showing that randomly initialized transformers already exhibit strong and systematic structural biases. In particular, untrained models display extreme token preferences: across random input sequences, certain tokens are predicted with probabilities orders of magnitude larger.\n  We provide a mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon by dissecting the transformer architecture at initialization. We show that extreme token preference arises from a contraction of token representations along a random seed-dependent direction. This contraction is driven by two interacting forces: (i) asymmetric nonlinear activations in MLP sublayers induce global (inter-sequence) representation concentration, and (ii) self-attention further amplifies this effect through local (intra-sequence) aggregation. Together, these mechanisms align hidden representations along a direction determined solely by the random initialization, producing highly non-uniform next-token predictions.\n  Beyond mechanistic insight, we demonstrate that these initialization-induced biases persist throughout training, forming a stable and intrinsic model identity. Leveraging this property, we introduce SeedPrint, a fingerprinting method that can reliably distinguish models that differ only in their random initialization, even after extensive training and under substantial distribution shift. Finally, we identify a fundamental positional discrepancy inherent to the attention mechanism's intra-sequence contraction that is causally linked to the attention-sink phenomenon.

To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components.

Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by \"Orthogonal Interference,\" where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not \"unlearn\" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude.

Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training.

To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining.

We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals.

However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications.

Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG.

Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers.

In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked.

While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $\u03b2_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p/2}}$, $p \\in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively.

However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k).

This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal.

This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact.

Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation.

Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value.

Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a \"loss landscape\" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\\% accuracy improvements and 49\\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods.

Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families.

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\u03c7^2$ regularizer. This additional $\u03c7^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
