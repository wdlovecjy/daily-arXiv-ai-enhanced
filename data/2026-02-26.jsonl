Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states. Overall, these capabilities position the framework as a reliable, uncertainty-aware foundation for neuromorphic computing."}

Under directional stability, we show that estimators that would have been efficient under i.i.d. data remain asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient when computed from adaptively collected trajectories. The canonical gradient has a martingale form, and directional stability guarantees stabilization of its predictable quadratic variation, enabling high-dimensional asymptotic normality. We characterize efficiency using a convolution theorem for the adaptive-data setting, and give a condition under which the one-step estimator attains the efficiency bound. We verify directional stability for LinUCB, yielding the first semiparametric efficiency guarantee for a regular scalar target under LinUCB sampling."}

Even more patients could be helped with a transplant if the rate of kidneys that are discarded and not transplanted could be reduced. Machine learning (ML) can support decision-making in this context by early identification of donor organs at high risk of discard, for instance to enable timely interventions to improve organ utilization such as rescue allocation. Although various ML models have been applied, their results are difficult to compare due to heterogenous datasets and differences in feature engineering and evaluation strategies. This study aims to provide a systematic and reproducible comparison of ML models for donor kidney discard prediction. We trained five commonly used ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning along with an ensemble model on data from 4,080 deceased donors (death determined by neurologic criteria) in Germany. A unified benchmarking framework was implemented, including standardized feature engineering and selection, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Model performance was assessed for discrimination (MCC, AUC, F1), calibration (Brier score), and explainability (SHAP). The ensemble achieved the highest discrimination performance (MCC=0.76, AUC=0.87, F1=0.90), while individual models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning performed comparably and better than Decision Trees. Platt scaling improved calibration for tree-and neural network-based models. SHAP consistently identified donor age and renal markers as dominant predictors across models, reflecting clinical plausibility. This study demonstrates that consistent data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation can be more decisive for predictive success than the choice of the ML algorithm."}

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution."}

This can be modeled as a sequential hypothesis testing problem with $k$ incoming streams of data and a global null hypothesis that asserts that the system is working as expected across all $k$ streams. The standard global test employs a Bonferroni correction and has an expected stopping time bound of $O\\left(\\ln\\frac{k}α\\right)$ when $k$ is large and the significance level of the test, $α$, is small. In this work, we construct new sequential tests by using ideas of merging test martingales with different trade-offs in expected stopping times under different, sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. We further derive a new, balanced test that achieves an improved expected stopping time bound that matches Bonferroni's in the sparse setting but that naturally results in $O\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\ln\\frac{1}α\\right)$ under a dense alternative.

These are subsequently applied in a sequence-to-sequence framework for traffic forecasting. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We use principal component analysis (PCA) to interpret the embeddings, revealing temporal patterns such as weekday versus weekend distinctions and seasonal patterns; (2) We propose a method that combines VAE and LSTM, enabling forecasting dynamic urban knowledge embedding; and (3) Our approach improves accuracy and responsiveness in traffic prediction models, including RNN, DCRNN, GTS, and GMAN.

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.\n  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates."}

Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection. For multimodal models, AngelSlim incorporates specialized pruning strategies, namely IDPruner for optimizing vision tokens via Maximal Marginal Relevance and Samp for adaptive audio token merging and pruning.

In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks.

This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node.

The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.\n  In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.\n  In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations. We conclude with a discussion on broader lessons and future work emerging from the thesis."}

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems."}

The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry.

Weaker models earn lower reliability levels (not accuracy -- see Definition 2.4): GPT-4.1 earns 94.6% on GSM8K and 96.8% on TruthfulQA, while GPT-4.1-nano earns 89.8% on GSM8K and 66.5% on MMLU.

However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing. Numerical experiments demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method."}

Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains."}

In contrast, the radiative near field (NF) supports multiple spatial DoF, enabled by spherical wavefronts and the reduced spatial footprint at short ranges. While recent research indicates that the effective DoF (EDoF) increases in NF, experimental validation and clear identification of the transition distances remain limited. In this letter, we develop an intuitive framework for characterizing the EDoF of a ULA-based MIMO system and derive two complementary analytical expressions: a closed-form formulation that relates the EDoF to the physical transmit beamwidth and receive aperture, and a discrete formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain angular decomposition of the NF spherical wavefront, which is well suited for experimental evaluation. We further introduce the effective MIMO Rayleigh distance (EMRD) and the maximum spatial multiplexing distance (MSMD), which mark the distances where the EDoF reduces to one and attains its maximum, respectively. Experimental measurements using widely spaced phased arrays closely match the theoretical EDoF trends and validate the proposed distance metrics."}

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety."}

We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains."}

Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios."}

The HiPPO framework, originally proposed by Gu & Dao et al., provides a principled approach to sequential compression by projecting signals onto orthogonal polynomial (OP) bases via structured linear ordinary differential equations. Subsequent works have embedded these dynamics in state space models (SSMs), where HiPPO structure serves as an initialization. Nonlinear successors of these SSM methods such as Mamba are state-of-the-art for many tasks with long-range dependencies, but the mechanisms by which they represent and prioritize history remain largely implicit. In this work, we revisit the HiPPO framework with the goal of making these mechanisms explicit. We show how polynomial representations of history can be extended to support capabilities of modern SSMs such as adaptive allocation of memory and associative memory while retaining direct interpretability in the OP basis. We introduce a unified framework comprising five such extensions, which we collectively refer to as a \"HiPPO zoo.\" Each extension exposes a specific modeling capability through an explicit, interpretable modification of the HiPPO framework. The resulting models adapt their memory online and train in streaming settings with efficient updates. We illustrate the behaviors and modeling advantages of these extensions through a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that capabilities typically associated with modern SSMs can be realized through explicit, interpretable polynomial memory structures."}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF."}

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation. This work documents which assumptions fail in practice and provides falsifiable baselines for future research on routing, retrieval, and multi-model attribution."}

This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$. We provide theory showing improved efficiency in terms of number of parameters on the synthetic Polynomial task (IHA uses $Θ(\\sqrt{k}n^2)$ parameters vs. $Θ(kn^2)$ for MHA) and on the synthetic order-sensitive CPM-3 task (IHA uses $\\lceil\\sqrt{N_{\\max}}\\rceil$ heads vs. $N_{\\max}$ for MHA).

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants."}

While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data.

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF."}

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF."}

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem."}

Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation."}

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts."}

Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings."}

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF."}

In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups."}

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states. Overall, these capabilities position the framework as a reliable, uncertainty-aware foundation for neuromorphic computing."}

Under directional stability, we show that estimators that would have been efficient under i.i.d. data remain asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient when computed from adaptively collected trajectories. The canonical gradient has a martingale form, and directional stability guarantees stabilization of its predictable quadratic variation, enabling high-dimensional asymptotic normality. We characterize efficiency using a convolution theorem for the adaptive-data setting, and give a condition under which the one-step estimator attains the efficiency bound. We verify directional stability for LinUCB, yielding the first semiparametric efficiency guarantee for a regular scalar target under LinUCB sampling."}

This can be modeled as a sequential hypothesis testing problem with $k$ incoming streams of data and a global null hypothesis that asserts that the system is working as expected across all $k$ streams. The standard global test employs a Bonferroni correction and has an expected stopping time bound of $O\\left(\\ln\\frac{k}α\\right)$ when $k$ is large and the significance level of the test, $α$, is small. In this work, we construct new sequential tests by using ideas of merging test martingales with different trade-offs in expected stopping times under different, sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. We further derive a new, balanced test that achieves an improved expected stopping time bound that matches Bonferroni's in the sparse setting but that naturally results in $O\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\ln\\frac{1}α\\right)$ under a dense alternative. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed tests on synthetic and real-world data."}

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.\n  We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates."}

Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined. Theoretical and empirical justifications for the superiority of the proposed algorithm are provided."}

The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.\n  In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.\n  In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations. We conclude with a discussion on broader lessons and future work emerging from the thesis."}
